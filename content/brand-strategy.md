## I) Brand DNA Exercises üß¨

We have a cognitive bias towards meaningful brands. We vouch for their success, we stay loyal and spread the gospel about them. That‚Äôs because they reflect our beliefs and reinforce our core characteristics.

In the Brand DNA exercises, you‚Äôll go through how you‚Äôll infuse a dash of ‚Äúmeaningful substance‚Äù to your business. The goal here is to establish high sense of purpose for your brand which will lead to attracting cult-like followings and a loyal costumer base.

### 1) Brand Golden Circle Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

In this exercise we‚Äôll brainstorm the following:

1. The **Why**:
   * The reason why your business exist and what‚Äôs the purpose behind it
2. The **How**:
   * How are you going to fulfill that reason or your brand‚Äôs end goal? And how will that benefit your costumer?
3. The **What**:
   * What does your brand do? And how does that relate to your costumer's day-to-day life?

The end goal is to formulate the insights from this exercise as a **Brand Credo,** a statement of the beliefs which guide your brand‚Äôs actions and communications (we'll see how to do this in the Brand Credo exercise).

Let‚Äôs start.

### üî¥ Step 1) brainstorming the Why:

![](/assets/images/5.png)

On the Why circle, you and your team try to think as to why the brand has come to fruition. What‚Äôs the purpose behind its existence and why should people care?

Take a couple of minutes to think and write down on sticky notes your answers. After that, pin the sticky notes to the Why circle.

Here‚Äôs a couple of questions to give you a headstart:

* Who are we helping?
* What are we helping them with?
* What Emotion do we want our target audience to have with the result we deliver?
* How could this emotion impact their lives?
* Does this have a knock-on effect elsewhere in their lives?
* How does this knock-on effect impact them practically?
* Based on what we do for our costumer, what is the biggest impact we can have in their lives?


### üî¥ Step 2) brainstorming the How:

In this section, we look at how your brand is going to fulfill the purpose of its existence and how that can benefit your costumer. And what‚Äôs the difference in the way you do your business.

On the How Circle, brainstorm the ongoing commitments your brand has to do to achieve its higher purpose.

Here are questions to ask yourself and your team:

* How are we going to achieve our end objective? And What are the day-to-day commitments that enable us to reach our goal?
* What‚Äôs the difference in our method of providng value?
* How could this benefit the costumer?
* How can we implement an action plan for our commitments?

{{% note "Note" %}} you must be specific and actionable about the How. Avoid non-practical statements like ‚ÄúTo provide costumer-centric service‚Äù or ‚Äúdelivering personalized experience‚Äù. Be specific as possible. 

Let's say for example that you're a hospital. So instead of saying ‚Äúwe provide convenient care‚Äù, try to be more elaborate like ‚Äúwe invest in the latest technology for faster healing and same-day care‚Äù. This way it‚Äôs more clear how you‚Äôre going to help the costumer.{{% /note %}}


### #\~Step 3) brainstorming the What:

This is the easiest part of the exercise. Here, we try to lay down all of your services or products and their features. On the What Circle, write down descriptions of your brand and the answers to the following questions:

* What does our brand do?
* What are the features we provide to our costumers?
* What are the things that we do or provide that other competitors don‚Äôt have?
* Describe your brand in 2 sentences
* Are there any perks or bonuses the costumer gets out of choosing us?

After you finished, your board will look like this:

![](/assets/images/6.jpg)  
  
Now that you have a strong idea of your brand, move on to the next exercise where you will consolidate your understanding.

=> [More info about this exercise](https://simonsinek.com/commit/the-golden-circle)

  

### 2) Brand Credo Write-Up ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

In this exercise, we aim to solidify our understanding of the brand‚Äôs golden circle. And we do this by writing a Brand Credo. A Brand Credo is a short statement that declares the philosophy and the principles that guide your brand.

From this credo, everything will branch out. Every communication, interaction, future decisions, projects, and partnerships, will be vetted against this credo. It will act as a filter to any aspect of your brand.

In the branding workshop, move onto the Brand Credo Exercise.

Each participant will have a blank paper where he or she can write down the credo. You can duplicate the papers for more people to use by selecting a paper then hold the Alt or ‚åò key while dragging it.

Here‚Äôs the basic template of a Brand Credo:

![](/assets/images/7.png)

Take 10-15 minutes and let the participant write their version of the credo. To help you write one here are some tips:

* In the first paragraph, write down why the brand exists. Go back to the Golden Circle and see the reasons behind the brand. It should give you an idea of what to write.
* In the second paragraph, write down how the brand is going to fulfill its promise. Here where you collect all of the How‚Äôs from the previous exercise and make a coherent statement
* The last paragraph is where you describe your brand and what it does. Keep it short and sweet.

{{% important %}} Your brand‚Äôs credo shouldn‚Äôt look like a generic and uninspiring mission statement. The Credo should be **different, powerful,** and **hard-hitting**. {{% /important %}}

Here are some examples for inspirations:

![](/assets/images/8.jpg)  
After you finish writing the credo, using the red voting above the exercise in miro, vote for what you think is the best credo that truly represents the brand.

Each participant vote counts as 1 point while the founder/owner‚Äôs vote counts as 2 points.

The highest-rated credo is the winner.

### 3) Brand Pillars ‚è∞ \[10-20 minute\]

![](/assets/images/9.png)  
In this exercise, you‚Äôre going to jot down your Brand‚Äôs Pillars. Brand Pillars are a set of guiding principles that shape every aspect of your business. They're placed at the very core of your brand and are there to dictate your brand message, identity, and personality.

These pillars will stem from your brand‚Äôs credo. The goal here is to reduce the philosophy of your credo to one or two words so we end up with a shorter & purified version.

Using the Brand Pillars exercise, write down on sticky notes the brand‚Äôs principles. Go back to the previous exercises to take inspiration and try to reduce the statements to one or two words.

Every brand pillar should pass the following questions:

* Can we hire or fire staff based on this pillar?
* Can we open new locations or subsidiaries without contradicting this pillar?
* Can we decide on partnerships/mergers based on this pillar?
* Can we add or remove services without being unfaithful to this pillar?
* Is there a double edge effect on our brand if we choose to adopt this pillar?

In the exercise, there are four brand pillars. From our experience, we‚Äôve seen that more than four will lead to confusion or diluting the brand‚Äôs meaning. So it‚Äôs best to limit it to 4 as max and 2 as a min.

For each brand principle, the team can brainstorm values and philosophies and pin them to their respective pillar.

After that, using the voting dots, vote for the best guiding principle with each participant vote count as 1 point and the leader/owner‚Äôs vote as 2 points.

The highest-rated principal will be considered a Brand Pillar.

Your result should end up something like this:

![](/assets/images/10.jpg)

  
**Important**: Again, try to avoid the generic use of common values like honesty, quality, accountability, and so on. While these values are admirable, they are overused and do not differentiate your brand. If one of them is truly one of your brand‚Äôs beliefs, that‚Äôs okay to add it. But that should be the exception rather than the rule.

### 4) Future Brand ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

The word ‚Äúvision‚Äù is tossed around a lot. But most corporate visions/missions are used as a superficial decoration rather than an actual plan to follow.

Many businesses copy the dull and uninspiring vision statements and paste them to their website as a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù kind of antique. This is a waste of time and opportunity.

Because without a shared understanding of the overarching goal you're trying to accomplish, you might grab at short-term gains while incurring the long-term loss of your brand‚Äôs identity.

And this exercise aims to combat that. We‚Äôre going to sketch a rough future for your brand and how it will look like years from now. The goal here is not to predict the future but to establish a loose structure.

By establishing such objectives, you‚Äôll know exactly where your brand is heading and how you‚Äôll arrive there.

Let‚Äôs start.

### **üî¥ Step 1) Future Brand Timeline:**

![](/assets/images/11-5.png)

On the branding workshop, move on to the Future Brand Timeline and follow the next 3 steps:

1. Take 15 minutes to move on through the timeline: use sticky notes and pin your writings on the timeline.
   * **(Now)**: where are you now? In terms of business metrics ‚Äî what‚Äôs your business size, costumer base, lifetime value, and so on
   * **(5 years)** Where do you see your brand in 5 years in terms of growth?
   * **(10 years)** If you achieve all your goals in 5 years, then What will your business look like in 10 years? How big will it be? and what other services/products could you offer? Will you expand to other locations?
   * **(15 years)** What impact will you have on your industry in 15 years? How will your brand branch out?
2. Next, in the aspiration field, Take 5 minutes to write down your ultimate aspiration. If it all goes right, how will you impact the field you‚Äôre in? Here you can use superlatives like ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs (safest, most loved, most convenient‚Ä¶)‚Äù
3. Finally, define your ideal future state ‚Äî your final destination or desired end state. What would the world look like if this problem was solved? If you were successful in what you do, how will your brand change its community?

  
![](/assets/images/11.jpg)

Share and discuss the notes and the writing with your team and move on to the next part of the exercise.

### üî¥ Step 2) Future Vision Statement:

![](/assets/images/12.png)

Here we‚Äôre going to formulate a vision statement for the brand using the findings from Future Brand Timeline.

On the candidates‚Äô quadrant, use sticky notes to write your candidates‚Äô vision statement. Use the Future Vision Statement template on the left to nail the format of the statement.

Try to fill in the gaps using the result from part 1 of the exercise.

After you brainstorm as many statements as possible, participants should use the red voting dots to vote for the best statement.

The highest-ranked statement is the winner.

![](/assets/images/13.png)

### 5) Brand Obituary ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

What will happen if your business closes its door tomorrow?

Would journalists write headlines heralding your past achievements, or would their stories simply add you to a list of bygones?

Would staff wonder how it could have ended, or would they have known it was inevitable?

Would costumers mourn your passing, or would the demise of your brand go unnoticed?

This creative exercise aims to contrast the previous one. It‚Äôs good to set goals for the future but it‚Äôs equally as good (if not better) to be proactive and work backward to check if your brand will pass the test of time.

The Brand Obituary exercise aims to force you to think through some of the key elements that make up a charismatic brand.  

The goal here is to write an obituary for your brand denoting its last days. 

The exercise is not meant to dishearten the staff members or your leadership team. It‚Äôs simply to extract critical aspects of the brand and to get a razor-sharp picture of its trajectory. 

Write down the obituary of your brand as if it were a person who just died yesterday.

Each participant should think of themselves as the journalist who has to report on the accident.

Much like writing the brand credo, each team member will have a paper to write down the obituary.  
  
![](/assets/images/14.png)

Things you need to include in the obituary:

* What will costumer remember it for?
* Who did your business leave behind?
* What did your brand leave unaccomplished?
* Who will mourn or miss your brand, and why?
* What lessons can be learned from the brand‚Äôs life?
* What can be learned in the wake of its death?
* Now that the brand is gone, what will take its place?

At the end of the exercise, discuss each other‚Äôs obituary and see what insights you can gather about your brand.

## II) Brand Positioning Exercises ‚ú®

In an age where the costumer's choice is expanding rapidly, where people are time-poor and information-rich; Where everyone is fist-fighting for your audience's short attention span, not differentiating your business is the same as being invisible.

And to combat this, the Brand Differentiation Exercises is meant to single your brand out of the sea of sameness. We‚Äôre going to implement 3 exercises that will focus on finding AND highlighting your brand‚Äôs unique differentiator. A differentiator that sets you apart and can‚Äôt be easily mimicked.

### 1) Audience Persona Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

Knowing your target audience lets you connect and align yourself with their needs. And for this, we‚Äôll use audience persona exercise; Where we stress your ideal costumer and their core characteristics.

The goal here is to get an overview of what makes your target audience tick. You‚Äôll explore what they like, fear, and desire. Knowing this we‚Äôll be key to finding a differentiator that matches their values.


### üî¥ Plotting your audience characteristics:

![](/assets/images/4.png)  
The audience persona diagram consists of 4 quadrants:

1. **Goals:**
   * This quadrant will hold info about your costumer's goals and main aspires.
2. **Problems:**
   * This is where you plot your costumer's issues, problems, and what hinders them from achieving their goals. (NOTE: theses issues should relate to how you can solve them, more on that in a second)
3. **Impact**
   * Here is where you plot the consequences of the problems your costumer has.
4. **Desires:**
   * What do they desire? What‚Äôs the perfect scenario they want when they purchase your brand?

You and your team start answering the following questions with respect to their quadrant:

* For **goals**: What objectives they have as it relates to your offering?
* For **problems**: What are the problems your costumer faces before they know you?
* For **Impact**: What do they fear because of those problems?
* For **Desires**: What‚Äôd be the desirable experience? What would be the best-case scenario after they bought your brand?

Use sticky notes and pin them to their respective quadrant.

Once you‚Äôve done that, use a different color sticky note on the middle circle to describe your target audience in 1 or 2 short sentences.

The result should look like this:

![](/assets/images/5.jpg)

### 2) Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

After getting a firm understanding of your audience, it‚Äôs time to develop a differentiator that matches their values. And for that, we‚Äôll use Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise‚Ñ¢ (BDG).

The BDG helps you achieve the following:

1. Plot potential unique value offers or differentiator, And;
2. Evaluate your possible differentiators based on how important they are to your costumer and;
3. To check whether or not the competition is using the same differentiators.

![](/assets/images/6.png)

Furthermore, the graph is split into four sections:

1. **Unappreciated efforts**:
   * This section holds everything that most of your competitors have and is of little importance to your costumer. Having an about us website is of no huge value to your costumer. And every competitor mostly has one. So it‚Äôs an unappreciated effort if you have one.
2. **Fulfilled priorities**:
   * This section holds critical parts of your business such as a good office space/parking lot. These are important for your costumer but it doesn‚Äôt set you apart per se.
3. **Secondary differentiators**:
   * Here are aspects of your business that are different and most competitors don‚Äôt have; however, at the same time, they don‚Äôt add that much value for your costumer. For example, an online booking system.
4. **Primary differentiators**:
   * These are differentiators that are key to your success. Because they add high value to your costumer and your competitors do not have this unique aspect. For example, if you‚Äôre an expert at athletic injuries and most of your competitors don‚Äôt have the same experience you have. Or if your start up delivers value that isn't found in the market.

On the x-axis is how important the differentiator is to your costumer. On the y-axis is how prevalent this differentiator is in the competitive landscape (how much it is used).

Brainstorm possible differentiators and write down on sticky notes possible unique aspects about your brand or a different approach to your service/product.

If you couldn‚Äôt come up with something, try to think of how you can outmaneuver everyone and take another approach to your company.

Here are few questions to give you a head start:

* What do we do differently and exceptionally well?
* What are the unmet needs that costumer are experiencing in our field?
* What do our competitors do mediocrely? Can we raise the bar?
* What are some of the industry ‚Äústandards‚Äù that we can diverge from?
* What sort of luxury costumer are not aware of, that could elevate their experience?

Write all of the possible ideas and start plotting them on the BDG.

The graph will look something like this

![](/assets/images/7.jpg)

After you have filled out all of the quadrants of the BDG, it‚Äôs time to hone in on ONE differentiator and highlight that as your ONLY thing your brand can do and others can‚Äôt.

### 3) Onliness (onlyness) Statement Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

Onliness Statement is a positioning statement that radically differentiates your brand and provides it with crystal clarity. It‚Äôs simple yet the hardest part of the positioning strategy.

The onliness statement declares the only thing that your business does uniquely and no other competitor can claim.

_![](/assets/images/8.png)_

The template of the statement is as follows:

Our \[Offering/Brand\] Is the only \[Category\] That \[Differentiator\].

Here are examples from our clients to take inspiration from:

![](/assets/images/9.jpg)

![](/assets/images/10-1.jpg)

![](/assets/images/positioning.jpg)

![](/assets/images/12-1.png)

### **#\~ Plotting your onliness statement:**

1. **First**:
   * take inspiration from the Brand Differentiator Graph‚Ñ¢ to finish your onliness statement. It is better to take primary differentiators from the graph because they are already unique to your business and competitors can‚Äôt copy them.
2. **Second**:
   * On the right side of the Onliness Statement Exercise template, there are four quadrants where you can stick candidates‚Äô statements. Participants should use sticky notes and try to come up with as many candidates as possible.
3. **Third:**
   * After you and your team gather a few ideas, use the red dots on the right side to vote on which one is the most suitable for your brand. As per usual, the founder has 2 points for his/her vote and the rest of the team 1 point.

After you‚Äôre done voting, the highest-ranked statement is your winner.

## III) Brand Persona Exercises üëÅÔ∏è

Brands aren‚Äôt just about the product or service they provide, but the meaning they represent, which people are using, in turn, to represent themselves.

Think of the owner of a Hyundai Ioniq who wears eco-friendly Patagonia clothing, buys coffee produced by fair trade standards and wears blood-free diamonds from Tiffany‚Äôs. This person is borrowing the meaning from these brands to tell a story about herself that ranges from her commitment to social responsibility to her love of quality and dedication to style.

This means that people are choosing brands as a way to self-identify themselves and communicate their values to the world. For example, If your target audience are environmentally-conscious people, it makes sense that your brand displays the quality of cleanliness and eco-friendliness. Eco-friendly people will choose eco-friendly brands because it reinforces their values and reflects their core attributes. This way there‚Äôs a match of values and purchase decisions are almost automatic.


And in the Brand Persona Exercises, we're going to see how to create this "match" of values and how to humanize the brand to be more relatable to your target audience.

### 1) Brand Archetypal Mix Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

To create a match between your brand‚Äôs traits and your target audience‚Äôs beliefs, we need to visit a concept coined by psychologist Carl Jung, and that is Archetypes.

An archetype is a typical character that represents universal patterns of human nature. These characters represent our core desires and aspirations. According to Jung, there are twelve archetypes:

_![](/assets/images/1.jpg)_

[Image Source](https://iconicfox.com.au/brand-archetypes/)

Archetypes, Jung suggested, were inborn tendencies that play a role in influencing human behavior. Archetypes are widely used in books, movies, and branding. For example, Yoda is the **Sage** in Star Wars. Indiana Jones is the **Explorer**, and Maximus is the **Hero** in the Gladiator.

![](/assets/images/2.jpg)

As you can see, each one of us has core desires and an archetype that represents them.

And in this exercise, we‚Äôll try to pick an archetype and _assign_ it to your brand. But, the trick here is to first identify your audience‚Äôs archetype, THEN, assign an archetype to your brand that would most appeal to them.

For example, let's say that your audience are pregnant women and your hospital helps deliver babies. Your costumers (mothers-to-be) archetype will be **the caregiver** (an archetype that is driven by the desire to protect and care for their children)

So, your brand‚Äôs archetype can be also a **caregiver**: meaning, your brand‚Äôs communication, and behaviors will carry characteristics of the caregiver archetype like soft-spoken messages/reassuring and supportive.

This way there‚Äôs a harmony between your costumer-base‚Äôs archetype and your brand‚Äôs.

But you don‚Äôt always have to mimic your audience‚Äôs archetype. For example, If your costumer desire power (the Ruler), it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that your brand should choose the Ruler archetype.

And that‚Äôs because if your brand is providing them with some kind of education, to help them get that power, then they're likely to be drawn to the **Sage** personality that demonstrates wisdom and knowledge.

A good rule of thumb is to have two archetypes for your brand. The first one will represent 70% of the brand and the second will represent 30% of it. The first one will be the prominent archetype and is what your audience will resonate with, and the second one to break the mold and differentiate the brand.

We‚Äôll go over some examples to further illustrate these concepts, but now let‚Äôs see how to define your brand archetypes.  

### üî¥ Action Step: Define your archetypal mix:

![](/assets/images/3.png)

On the brand archetype wheel, identify the core desires of your target audience, and based on that, think about what role your brand plays in their lives.

To define your brand archetype, follow the next steps:

* Discuss with your team what are the core desires of your target audience and how it relates to their problems.
* Use sticky notes to write down the archetypal mix percentage of your brand (ex: 70% Sage, 30% Caregiver) based on their desire.
* Each participant should pin their answers to the quadrant and start the voting
* Use the red voting dots on the right to decide on the best suitable mix for your brand. The highest voted answer is the winner.

![](/assets/images/4-1.png)

Once you know the desire, pick an archetype that fits it.

### 2) Brand Commitment Matrix Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

Now you have a brand‚Äôs archetype that fits its audience, let‚Äôs see how we can further align your brand with your costumer's values. And for this, we‚Äôre going to use the Brand Commitment Matrix (BCM).

BCM is a document that maps out the basic contract between your brand and its audience. Here‚Äôs how it works: Two columns, one for costumer and one for the brand. Each column contains three key statements.

For costumers, the statements will describe their IDENTITY (who they are), their AIMS (what they want), and their MORES (how they belong). These form the acronym IAM.

For the brand, the statements will describe its PURPOSE (why we exist), its ONLYNESS (what we offer), and its VALUES (how we behave). These form the acronym POV.

The statements in each column should line up horizontally: costumer's identity and your brand‚Äôs purpose should align; costumers aims and your services'/products' ‚Äúonlyness‚Äù (differentiator) should support each other, and mores and brand values should be in sync.

![](/assets/images/5-1.png)

### üî¥ Action Step: Fill in the Brand Commitment Matrix

To start filling out the BCM, first explain to the team the goal of this exercise and how it‚Äôll help us further align the brand with our target audience.

After that move on to the next steps:

1. **Customer Column:**
   * For the **IDENTITY**: In this space ask the team to describe the target audience in a couple of sentences and write down the answers.
   * For the **AIMS**: these are their goals as it relates to your brand‚Äôs services/products. Ask the team to write down a list of aims the costumer's wants to achieve.
   * For the **MORES**: these are the rules in which your audience behave in their community. What do they dislike? And what are some of the absolute rules they live by? How do they interact with each other? (are they outspoken and articulate? Or reserved and calm?) what‚Äôre their day-to-day activities like? Do they try to avoid something? Or care about a cause? List as much mores as you can and move on to the brand column
2. **Brand Column:**
   * For the **PURPOSE**: Start by writing down your brand‚Äôs Why or its reason to exist. You can borrow some of the ideas and statements from the first stage, Brand DNA.
   * For the **ONLYNESS**: Here you write down your onliness statement that you‚Äôve created in the second lesson Brand Differentiation stage
   * For the **VALUES**: Here you write down your brand‚Äôs pillar and how they correlate with your audience's mores.

![](/assets/images/6-1.png)

Once you‚Äôre done, move on to the next exercise where we dive into part 2 of this stage, the Brand Persona.

=> [More info about this exercise](https://www.martyneumeier.com/the-brand-flip)

### 3) Brand Voice Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

In this phase of the process, we craft Brand Voice Guidelines. This is the tone and language used when communicating your message, ads, marketing, website copy, or when talking with costumers.

Think of Brand Voice as the unique manner in which your brand expresses itself. Is it serious or playful? authoritative or empathetic? feminine or masculine? Your brand voice should be one that your costumer will engage and relate to.

The ultimate goal of this exercise is to develop a unique ‚Äúvoice‚Äù for your brand so that your messages will go intact and straight into people‚Äôs minds. A voice that‚Äôs highly targeted towards your audience and speaks to them on a personal level.

Let‚Äôs see some good examples of brand voices so you have an idea of what a distinct voice looks like.

### Examples of brand voice

**#\~The Joint Chiropractic**: Their voice in social media is **laid-back**, **casual**, and **uplifting.**

![](/assets/images/7-1.jpg)

![](/assets/images/8-1.jpg)

**The Economist brand‚Äôs voice.**

A tongue-in-cheek billboard advert for The Economist in 1990 that sympathizes with their target audience: CEOs and company executives.

![](/assets/images/9-1.jpg)

Strip away the huge salary and the executive jet, and you find much solitary misery. Even chief executives are human.

The economist‚Äôs tone of voice and the message connects deeply with their audience, creating stronger bonds and loyalty for the brand.

![](/assets/images/10.png)

![](/assets/images/12.jpg)

Here‚Äôs an example of the unique voice of a mobile app from The Desk Magazine. Although the weather app market is saturated, AuthenticWeather tries to slice through the ‚Äúme too‚Äù apps by their witty communication.

![](/assets/images/13-2.png)

![](/assets/images/15-1.jpg)


### üî¥ Action Step: Define your brand‚Äôs communication style

Using the Brand Voice Sliders (BVS) Exercise, let‚Äôs decide on what voice your brand will claim. The BVS aims to gauge to which extent your brand is humorous, formal, respectful, enthusiastic and what attitude it has.

![](/assets/images/19.png)

* **First**: Discuss with your team how your target audience communicate and what sort of behavior they have. (you can check previous exercises for help).
* **Second**: using the slider dots, drag each one to the left or the right depending on what manner your brand will maintain.
* **Third**: There are good reasons to be on the left or right of any of these lines, and it‚Äôs even okay if some of your sliders end up in the middle. But it‚Äôs helpful to be strongly opinionated on at least one or two ranges.

After you finish, your result will look something like this:

![](/assets/images/20.png)

Once your brand‚Äôs voice is decided, let‚Äôs define its tones.

### 4) Brand Tone Projection Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

What‚Äôs the difference between brand voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you‚Äôre addressing.

The same is true for your brand. Its voice doesn‚Äôt change much from day to day, but the tone changes all the time depending on the context.

To define your brand‚Äôs tone, we‚Äôll project its voice across [4 dimensions ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/)of speaking: humor, formality, respectfulness, and enthusiasm.

The goal is to answer the following questions:

* How humorous will your communication be?
* How formal is your brand when talking?
* Level of respectfulness infused in a speaking manner, and;
* How enthusiastically the brand‚Äôs voice will be

### üî¥ Action Step: Define your brand‚Äôs tones

![](/assets/images/21.png)

Let‚Äôs use the Tone Projections Exercise to start defining the brand‚Äôs tone of voice. After you explain to the participant the goal of the exercise move on to the action steps:

* On the right of the exercise, there are four quadrants with their respective dimensions of speaking. In each quadrant, participants will pin sticky notes that contain a statement that describes how the brand will speak in that particular dimension.
* The statement template goes as follow: We‚Äôre___, but we‚Äôre not____. E.g. ‚Äúwe‚Äôre forward-looking, but we‚Äôre not jumpy‚Äù
* Fill each quadrant with as many examples as you can. And repeat the process for the rest of the quadrants.

Here‚Äôs an example of the final result:

Once you‚Äôre done, it‚Äôs time to solidify your brand‚Äôs voice and get a clear picture of how your brand communicates.

### 5) Brand Interview Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

![](/assets/images/23.png)

This is the final exercise of this workshop. The brand Interview Exercise aims to test out the voice we‚Äôve developed until now. It's great to flesh out the way the brand speaks.

In this exercise, we‚Äôll visualize your brand as a person and we‚Äôre interviewing him/her. We‚Äôll pose a series of questions and answer them as the brand.

These questions aim to solidify the brand voice by putting into practice how your brand communicates.

Let‚Äôs see how it works.

### üî¥ Action Step: Brand Interview

1. On the brand interview exercise, you‚Äôll see a list of questions to ask your brand. Explain the exercise to your team and let them answer the question as the brand itself.
2. Each participant will have his/her section where they can answer the questions and test their understanding of the newly developed brand voice.
3. After the team has finished answering all of the questions, discuss your answers and see what insights you can gather.

After you‚Äôre done, the final result will look something like this:

## IV) Brand Storytelling üìñ

Imagine what you want to say to your costumer goes through intact - crystal clear and potent? What if your messages are perceived straight into people's brains without distortion, noise, or the need to think too much about it? that's where stories come in.

Well-told stories sell. why? Because they can go where quantitative analysis is denied admission: our hearts. Data can persuade people, but it doesn‚Äôt inspire them to act.


And today, we‚Äôre going to use Brand Storytelling to shrink the ‚Äúpsychic distance‚Äù between your business and your audience so that a relationship can begin to develop. 

But before we explain the exercises, let's start by understanding the concept behind this strategy.

### The 4 components of brand storytelling

![](/assets/images/1-1.jpg)

### 1) Brand DNA

![](/assets/images/2-1.jpg)

This refers to the core aspects of your brand. The credo of your business and the values that glue it together. We discussed how to cultivate brand DNA in lesson 1.

### 2) Core Messages

_![](/assets/images/3-1.jpg)_

Core Messages are all you need your costumer to know about your brand, how it can benefit them, and what makes it **different**. These messages will not focus on your brand per se but on what it can do for your audience.

In particular, core messages contain the following:

1. **Differentiators**
   * What makes your brand different from other alternatives? And how can this benefit your audience?
2. **Key Benefits**
   * What are the benefits your products/services provide to your customer? How does it enhance the their experience or outcomes?
3. **Audience**
   * Who is your target audience and what do you want them to understand about your brand? And why are we catering to them?
4. **Pain-Points**
   * What challenges they are facing your products/services can solve? How these obstacles are hindering their progress?

![](/assets/images/4-1.jpg)  
These messages will act as the ‚Äútheme‚Äù of your storytelling campaign and will direct every touchpoint (point of contact) your costumer has with your brand.

![](/assets/images/5-1.jpg)

### 3) Secondary Messages

![](/assets/images/6-1.jpg)

Unlike the Core Messages, Secondary messages are more centered around your brand, its purpose, and mission. In this stage, you‚Äôll hone in on the true north that guides your firm and the values it upholds. These messages are secondary to the campaign but are crucial for brand awareness.

Secondary Messages will stem from your brand‚Äôs Pillars, Credo, and Future Brand. The aspects which we discussed in lesson 1.

![](/assets/images/7-2.jpg)

### 4) Communication Framework

![](/assets/images/8-2.jpg)

Your audience is probably busy people who won't have the time to hear your ‚Äústory about x‚Äù. Your audience‚Äôs attention span is limited. And to convey your brand‚Äôs messages you‚Äôll need a new way of communication. This is where the communication framework comes in.

At this stage, we‚Äôre going to develop a framework from which you can easily dissect the story blocks and communicate them to your audience. I‚Äôll share some examples in a minute. But first, let‚Äôs see the main component of this framework.

The Communication Framework (CF) Contains two main components: **1)** The message blocks (these are your Core and Secondary Messages). And **2)** Story Blocks.

![](/assets/images/9-2.jpg)

Story blocks are what will allow you to communicate with your audience in a novel way. Let‚Äôs see how they work.

### What are Story Blocks and why do they work?

Story blocks are the formula we‚Äôre going to use to launch the campaign as a form of a story. This formula has been used in novels, movies, and famous plays. The messages we‚Äôve been developing up until now will be deployed in a manner akin to a novel or a movie, but this time, it‚Äôll market your business and its care services/products.

This formula follows a dramatic arc in which a character (your audience) struggles and eventually finds heretofore unknown abilities (your brand) and uses these to triumph over adversity; many [studies ](https://hbr.org/2014/03/the-irresistible-power-of-storytelling-as-a-strategic-business-tool)show that the brain is highly attracted to this story style.

![](/assets/images/9-5.jpg)

This formula contains 7 blocks:

1. **Current State (The Existing World)**
   * This is the current state of your audience without your services/brand. At this stage, we create an environment that is relatable to your target audience and all the marketing messages should create a sense of familiarity and build trust.
2. **The Obstacle**
   * This block will contain messages that relate to the problems your audience is currently facing. all the messages here must be aimed at these issues and how we can assist the costumer to navigate them.
3. **Call To Action**
   * This section will focus on the consequences of unresolved issues and what might happen if these issues are left untreated. This will trigger adaptation for your services/products and highlight the issues it solves.
4. **Meeting The Guide**
   * The guide here is your brand. Here we showcase what your brand can do and how it can slash your audience‚Äôs problems in half. Marketing messages in this section should reassure, assist, and help your audience progress towards better results using your services/products.
5. **Challenge**
   * In this section, we‚Äôre going to highlight the aspects of fears, challenges, and inner insecurities and try to relate to your audience. Thus creating trust and preference towards your brand.
6. **Change**
   * Your target audience is looking for a change. Otherwise, they wouldn‚Äôt invest in your products/services. This phase will shed light on what is the impact and transformation your brand had on its costumers.
7. **The New State (The New World)**
   * Marketing in this stage will be on how your audience‚Äôs life without the problems they faced before. Unlike the first story block, messages here will focus on how life is _after_ your brand solved all of its issues.

![](/assets/images/10-2.jpg)

{{% note "Note" %}}It is important to remember that in the storytelling campaign, the ‚Äúhero‚Äù is your target audience. Your brand will play the role of the ‚Äúguide‚Äù or the brand that helps them solve their issues and accelerates their progress.{{% /note %}}

### Examples of brand storytelling

Now that we have our Message Blocks and Story Blocks, we can use the Communication Framework to form marketing assets and deploy our messages as stories.

To launch the campaign, we need to select what parts of the story we need to market and what messages we need to infuse in these stories.

Let‚Äôs say that your hospital brand is all about safety and your target audience is safety-minded people.

Here‚Äôs an example of a campaign that stresses your audience‚Äôs **challenges** (being safe whilst in an insecure place) while speaking to them at a deep level.

![](/assets/images/11-11.jpg)

You could then take this idea of how to be safe during uncertain times and make a series of marketing messages around the audience‚Äôs challenges and how your brand (the guide) helps them overcome such issues.

Another example: Let‚Äôs say that your audiences are dentists and your brand sells CEREC Machines. A good way to start the storytelling campaign would be to form a combination between dentists‚Äô pain points and their obstacles.

![](/assets/images/12-1.jpg)

Or if your brand is a productivity app that help people get more done:

![](/assets/images/storytelling-examples-9.jpg)

Now, all that is left is selecting what part of the story we‚Äôre going to tell next and in what medium or platform the story will be distributed.

### Brand Storytelling Exercises 

This workshop is the practical step-by-step process to what we‚Äôve been discussing so far. We‚Äôre going to craft a communication framework from which you‚Äôll be able to market your business in the form of a story.

**Note:** this workshop will contain a fair amount of writing and brainstorming ideas. However, it‚Äôs the easiest to outsource since there isn‚Äôt much collaborative effort needed. If you‚Äôre busy and don‚Äôt have the time to do it, you can hand this lesson to your team to follow the steps outlined below. Or you can contact me at sliman@unnus.com and I‚Äôll have my team help you out.

### 1) Brand Messages Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

![](/assets/images/15.png)

In this exercise, we‚Äôre going to craft your brand‚Äôs Core Messages (CM) and Secondary Messages (SM). These messages will be then used in the communication framework to convey your brand‚Äôs characteristics and its differentiators.

CMs will be focused on your audience, their pain points, and your differentiator. The goal of these messages is to highlight the benefits of using your care services and the solution you provide.

SMs, on the other hand, is focused on your brand, its purpose, and its values. These messages will be less prominent in your marketing but they are essential in some stages.

Let‚Äôs dive into the exercise.

### üî¥ Action Step: Fill in the Brand Messages Table

To start the exercise, explain to the team the goal of the Brand Messages and follow the next steps:

1. **In the Core Messages column:**
   * To craft Core Messages, we‚Äôre going to apply the single word question formula to your Audience, their pain points, key benefits, and differentiator. We want to expand on these aspects and form messages around them.
   * Apply the single word question formula on each element by posing the appropriate question on the element. For example: on the audience element, we might pose the question **Who and Why.** E,g. Who are we catering to? And why are we catering to them? After that write down your answer on a sticky note and pin them in the core messages column. Be elaborate in writing down these answer and keep in mind your brand‚Äôs voice
   * Another example might be the differentiator. E,g. **How** are we different from other brands? And **What** makes us the only one? Do the same thing for the first four elements and pin the answer in the core Message column
2. **In the Secondary Messages column:**
   * Apply the same steps to fill in the SM column. Start by asking the appropriate question to the following components: Brand‚Äôs why, Brand‚Äôs How, Brand‚Äôs Pillars, and Future Brand.
   * E,g. **What** are our brand Pillars and **How** are they helping our costumer facilitate their success? Another example will be: **How** is our brand purpose (Brand‚Äôs why) different from others? And **What** makes it unique?
   * Do the same thing for the rest of the components and pin your answer to the SM column

Once you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll end up with a result like this:

![](/assets/images/16.png)

These elaborate answers will form your Brand Messages and you‚Äôll be able to inject them later with your brand‚Äôs marketing.

### 2) Brand Story Framework Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

The goal of this exercise is to brainstorm story ideas at each stage of the storytelling campaign: The Existing World, The Obstacle, Call To Action, Meeting The Guide, The Change, and The New World. These micro ideas will then be turned into a marketing asset (video, blog article, event, etc) using the Communication Framework (we‚Äôll see how next).

This way your marketing will be directed by a story framework and will provide your audience with a story-like theme while highlighting your positioning and building credibility.

**Keep in mind:** that Storytelling in marketing is like watching the movie pulp fiction. Although the scenes are not in a particular order, in the end, they will form a coherent understanding of the plot. Same with your brand storytelling. Your audience will not consume these stories in chronological order, but through the constant exposure with your brand, bit by bit, the whole story is conveyed.

### üî¥ Action Step: Fill in the Story Blocks

![](/assets/images/17-1.png)

Begin by stating the objectives of this exercise to the participants. There are 7 sub-exercises in this section but they all follow the same instruction. If you have a big team you might want to divide your team to separate group and each group will be responsible for each sub-exercise

After that, follow the next steps:

1. Each sub-exercise contain three columns:
   * **Story Answer**: in this column, you will write down the answers to the questions on the left-hand side. These questions are meant to provide you with what your audience is experiencing _at_ this stage of the story. For example: in the obstacle stage (the part of the story where your target audience is facing problems/issues) questions like: ‚ÄúHow do they feel about their problems‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt they overcome these issues‚Äù will provide us with great clarity on their current situation.
   * **Story Blocks**: in this column, you‚Äôll take the answers from the Story Answers column and string them together into an elaborate mini-story. This way we have a coherent description of their feelings.
   * **Micro Ideas**: in this column, take the mini-story you formed in the Story Block column and derive micro-ideas and stories about it. The goal here is to generate as many micro-stories and ideas that relate to this stage of the story.
2. **Fill in the columns:**
   * Start by answering the questions using sticky notes and pinning them to the Story Answers column. Keep it brief.
   * Elaborate on these answer by forming a mini-story out of these answers
   * Derive micro-stories out of the mini-story in the Story Block.

Here are some examples:

![](/assets/images/18-1.png)

Once you‚Äôre done, it‚Äôs time to use these story blocks and your brand Messages to market your medical business.

## 3) Brand Communication Framework

![](/assets/images/19-1.png)

This is less of an exercise and more of a framework for you to deploy your content from. Think of this framework as the portal from which you produce marketing content/assets. Now all is left is the selection process and what part of the story you want to market to your costumer.

For example, if you‚Äôd like to launch a marketing campaign around the problems your services solve, you might want to go to The Obstacle block and grab the stories/micro ideas and pin them to the Story Block Column.

After that, go back to the Brand Messages Exercise and pick what part of your brand or positioning you want to highlight in the campaign. In this case, since we‚Äôre going to tell stories about The Obstacle your audience faces, you might want to select a core message that highlights your solution to this problem. This way there‚Äôs harmony in the messaging.

After selecting the story and the messages you want to market, pin them to their respective column in the Communication framework.

![](/assets/images/20-1.png)

What‚Äôs left now is to turn these stories into marketing assets. You can do this yourself or you can hand this framework to your marketing team or outsource them easily.

Now everything is set and done, you can keep selecting what part of the story you want to market and what messages should be injected into them. This way your brand‚Äôs story will be communicated to your audience block by block.

## V) Brand Art Direction üìÑ


Your visuals can turn your business into a premium brand. And the reason for that is because of how our brain interprets visual elements. We are visual beings and we‚Äôre biased towards what is visually appealing and aesthetically meaningful. 


Visual identity is the look and aesthetics of your branding assets. It‚Äôs what we call external branding. It consists of office design, logotypes, typography, website, referral pads, color schemes, signage, etc.

Your external branding should reflect and give meaning to your brand. It‚Äôs the first interaction the costumer has with your business. Think of it as an ‚Äúoptical communication‚Äù with your audience.


What we want to do with Brand Art Direction Exercises is to break the outdated and predictable designs and give your brand fresh, costume visuals that are based on your positioning, brand DNA, and core messages.

### 1) Brand Keyword Essence Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

The goal of this exercise is to distill your brand‚Äôs core attributes to categorized keywords so we can easily choose a relevant style based on said keywords. Let‚Äôs see how that works.

### üî¥ Action Step: Fill in the brand keyword map:

![](/assets/images/1.png)

The brand keyword map will allow you to brainstorm a bunch of keywords related to different aspects of your brand. Each branch represents a different element of the brand and the keywords that are related to that element.

1. Use sticky notes to write down a list of keywords on each branch. Make sure to check back on your brand‚Äôs attributes from the previous workshop. It‚Äôll help give you an idea of what keywords are relevant.
2. Use websites like [Powerthesaurus ](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/)or [Words To Use](https://www.words-to-use.com/) to get synonyms for these keywords.
3. After you have filled the branches with the needed keywords, use the voting dots to vote for 3-4 keywords that are the most representative of your brand.
4. Save the highest rated keywords and move on to the next exercise

After you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll be left with something like this:

![](/assets/images/2.png)

### 2) Brand Visualization Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

Next, you‚Äôll take the 3 keywords from the last step and give them a visual aspect. Think of this step as putting a ‚Äúdress‚Äù on these keywords.

You see, here is where meaning intersects with design.

For example, the visual aspect of the word ‚ÄúClass‚Äù will be as follows:

* **Physical**: ‚Äúclass‚Äù indicates that something is ‚áí **Thin/Elegant**.
* **Emotional**: ‚Äúclass‚Äù gives the sense of ‚áí **Charm** or **Politeness**.
* **Descriptive**: ‚ÄúClass‚Äù describes a ‚áí **Traditional** feel.

You‚Äôll apply the same technique for each keyword you chose.

### üî¥ Action Step: Fill in the Visualization table:

![](/assets/images/3-1.png)

Take the keywords you chose in the last step and apply the same visualization technique to each one of them.

1. Put the keywords on the Keyword column. And for For each one, identify its visual aspect
2. For **physical**: If this keyword was an object, how would it look? Is it big, small, or tall? Is it sturdy or soft? Etc‚Ä¶
3. For **Emotional:** What feeling does this keyword give? If you hear it out loud hundreds of times, would you feel courageous? Reassured? Or energetic?
4. For **Descriptive:** Try to describe the feeling you get out of hearing this keyword. Does it feel trustworthy? Or vigor? Does it feel hopeful or negative?

After you‚Äôre done, your result should look like this:

![](/assets/images/4-2.png)

### 3) Brand Creative Process ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

Now that we have generated keywords that represent your brand and gathered a general sense of their visual elements, it‚Äôs time to create art guidelines for bringing them to life.

In this exercise, we‚Äôre going to create an outlook theme that dictates how your external branding (website, colors, logo, business collateral, office interior, etc) will look like.

### üî¥ Action Step: Fill in the Creative Process table:

![](/assets/images/5-2.png)

To create the external branding guidelines, we‚Äôll need to finish establishing the characteristics of each branding aspect of your business. For the sake of brevity, I‚Äôll cover how to write guidelines for the logo, Color Schemes, Typography, and Imagery Style.

1. The Creative Process Table consists of 4 columns
   * **The identity:** the identity item
   * **The primary traits**: these are the dominant visual element in the design.
   * **The Trait Combination**: these are traits that provide a mix of design elements
   * **Theme Description**: these are the elaborate description of how the item design should look like
2. For **Primary Traits**: use sticky notes to write down how the identity item should look _based_ on the visual element of your brand keyword.
3. For **Trait Combination**: in this column, write down a mix of design elements to break the mold of the primary traits.
4. For **Theme description**: use sticky notes to write down an elaborate overall description of how the identity item should look like. For example, Let‚Äôs say that your brand stands for security and safeteness. You might describe how the logo will look by writing something like ‚ÄúLogo should have a rectangular look to indicate stability and reliance‚Äù.

Apply the same method for the four identity items. Once you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll end up with something like this:

![](/assets/images/6-2.png)

Now that the art direction is done, you can hand the guidelines to your designer and he‚Äôll take care of the execution.
