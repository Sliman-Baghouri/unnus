Well-told stories sell. why? Because they can go where quantitative analysis is denied admission: our hearts. Data can persuade people, but it doesn’t inspire them to act.

And today, we’re going to use Brand Storytelling to shrink the "psychic distance” between your medical business and your ideal patient so that a relationship can begin to develop.

Up until now, everything was internal. Your positioning, Brand DNA, and Brand Voice. And today, we'll tie everything together to form a strong storytelling framework for effective messaging.

But first, let’s discuss why stories have a strong influence on us.

## How stories influence preference-based judgments

Alongside the ability to influence is the fact that people automatically link stories to their own experiences to make them more relatable. We cry, laugh, and get angry when we watch stories because we’re drawing parallels with our own lives.

And if your brand can craft a well-plotted story, your audience will share the emotions of the characters in it, and after it ends, they will likely _continue_ mimicking the feelings and behaviors of those characters.

This explains the feeling of dominance you have after James Bond saves the world, and your motivation to work out after watching the Spartans fight in 300.

This also means that you can turn your medical brand’s selling points into a story that tells the tale of frustration or problem that your patient can associate with their own experience. You can then 'plant' your medical business as the happy resolution to that story. Once you've planted that idea, people will continue with the narrative of their own experience and “come up” with the idea of using your care service to solve their issue.

But the sad truth is, everyone is a storyteller nowadays. I’m sure that you’ve heard the term “storytelling” before and I’m equally sure you’re still wondering about its practical results/implementation in a closely regulated industry like healthcare

This is why today, I’m going to share with you the following:

* How Storytelling works in healthcare
* Examples of storytelling
* Practical Step-by-step strategy for using storytelling to market your medical business
* Workshop exercises, frameworks, and worksheets to give you a head start

Let’s dive in.

## Brand Storytelling Strategy: The unmatched way of marketing your medical business

Brand Storytelling is a strategy used to communicate with your target audience in a novel, digestible, and more trustworthy way. The strategy focuses on creating inspiring stories around your brand, its care services, and your audience.

There are 4 key components of this strategy, let’s tackle each.

## The 4 components of brand storytelling

### 1) Brand DNA

![](/assets/images/2-1.jpg)

This refers to the core aspects of your brand. The credo of your medical business and the values that glue it together. We discussed how to cultivate brand DNA in lesson 1.

### 2) Core Messages

_![](/assets/images/3-1.jpg)_

Core Messages are all you need your patient to know about your brand, how it can benefit them, and what makes it **different**. These messages will not focus on your brand per se but on what it can do for your audience. 

In particular, core messages contain the following:

1. **Differentiators**
   * What makes your medical brand different from other alternatives? And how can this benefit your audience?
2. **Key Benefits**
   * What are the benefits your care services provide to your patient/customer? How does it enhance the patient experience or outcomes?
3. **Audience**
   * Who is your target audience and what do you want them to understand about your brand? And why are we catering to them?
4. **Pain-Points**
   * What challenges they are facing your services can solve? How these obstacles are hindering their progress?

These messages will act as the “theme” of your storytelling campaign and will direct every touchpoint (point of contact) your patient has with your brand.

### 3) Secondary Messages

Unlike the Core Messages, Secondary messages are more centered around your brand, its purpose, and mission. In this stage, you’ll hone in on the true north that guides your firm and the values it upholds. These messages are secondary to the campaign but are crucial for brand awareness.

Secondary Messages will stem from your brand’s Pillars, Credo, and Future Brand. The aspects which we discussed in lesson 1.

### 4) Communication Framework

Your audience is probably busy people who won't have the time to hear your “story about x”. Your audience’s attention span is limited. And to convey your brand’s messages you’ll need a new way of communication. This is where the communication framework comes in.

At this stage, we’re going to develop a framework from which you can easily dissect the story blocks and communicate them to your audience. I’ll share some examples in a minute. But first, let’s see the main component of this framework.

The Communication Framework (CF) Contains two main components: **1)** The message blocks (these are your Core and Secondary Messages). And **2)** Story Blocks.

Story blocks are what will allow you to communicate with your audience in a novel way. Let’s see how they work.

### What are Story Blocks and why do they work?

Story blocks are the formula we’re going to use to launch the campaign as a form of a story. This formula has been used in novels, movies, and famous plays. The messages we’ve been developing up until now will be deployed in a manner akin to a novel or a movie, but this time, it’ll market your medical business and its care services/products.

This formula follows a dramatic arc in which a character (your audience) struggles and eventually finds heretofore unknown abilities (your brand) and uses these to triumph over adversity; many [studies ](https://hbr.org/2014/03/the-irresistible-power-of-storytelling-as-a-strategic-business-tool)show that the brain is highly attracted to this story style.

This formula contains 7 blocks:

* **Current State (The Existing World)**
  * This is the current state of your audience without your services/brand. At this stage, we create an environment that is relatable to your target audience and all the marketing messages should create a sense of familiarity and build trust.
* **The Obstacle**
  * This block will contain messages that relate to the problems your audience is currently facing. all the messages here must be aimed at these issues and how we can assist the patient to navigate them.

1. **Call To Action**
   * This section will focus on the consequences of unresolved issues and what might happen if these issues are left untreated. This will trigger adaptation for your services/products and highlight the issues it solves.
2. **Meeting The Guide**
   * The guide here is your brand. Here we showcase what your brand can do and how it can slash your audience’s problems in half. Marketing messages in this section should reassure, assist, and help your audience progress towards better results using your services/products.
3. **Challenge**
   * In this section, we’re going to highlight the aspects of fears, challenges, and inner insecurities and try to relate to your audience. Thus creating trust and preference towards your brand.
4. **Change**
   * Your target audience is looking for a change. Otherwise, they wouldn’t invest in your care services. This phase will shed light on what is the impact and transformation your brand had on its patients.
5. **The New State (The New World)**
   * Marketing in this stage will be on how your audience’s life without the problems they faced before. Unlike the first story block, messages here will focus on how life is _after_ your brand solved all of its issues.
