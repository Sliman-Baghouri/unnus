{{% hook %}}In an age where the patient choice is expanding rapidly, where people are time-poor and information-rich; Where everyone is fist-fighting for your patient’s short attention, not differentiating your medical business is the same as being invisible.{{% /hook %}}

***

For the first time in history, competition does not come from your direct competitors, indeed, but from the market clutter.

![](/assets/images/clear-the-clutter.png)

According to research done by the Red Crown Marketing agency, It is estimated that the average person encounters between 6,000 to 10,000 ads daily. All from the same sounding brands, providing the same sounding offers with the same sounding voice.

This rushing flood of me-too brands forces our brains to deal with this clutter the best way it knows how—by blocking most of it out. And what’s left is the interesting, the inspiring, and the different.

Differentiation works because our cognitive system works. Our brains, to protect us from this vast amount of irrelevant information, learn to distinguish between the “lookalike” and the unique.

This way we only pay attention to what’s valuable and we don’t have to waste our time hearing the same marketing messages over and over.

And in this lesson, we’re going to find strategic ways for you to cut through the “me too” brands and highlight what’s unique about yours.

After this workshop, your brand won’t compete, but rather render the competition _irrelevant_.

This lesson covers:

1. What is positioning? And how it can help you attract more patients
2. To Focus or to defocus, why you should “focus” your brand
3. Brand Differentiation Workshop
   * Audience Persona Exercise
   * Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise™
   * Onliness Statement Exercise
4. What’s next

## “Is The Man Listening? Privacy Sold Here”

In one of the episodes of the show Better Call Saul, the protagonist, James Mcgill, had to work in a mobile store where there are no customers whatsoever.

The branch James worked in sells the same phones as every competitor. There was nothing that merits his store.

Fed up with this, one day, James painted on the store’s frontend the following statement:

**_“Is The Man Listening? Privacy Sold Here”_**

While you can buy the same phone somewhere else, James sells you **privacy**.

He differentiated the store to be **the only store that sells privacy to its customer**. It’s his positioning statement. A statement that declares the store’s differentiator.

He knows that his surrounding area is full of drug dealers and smugglers. So The statement “Privacy sold here” resonates with people that want to keep a low profile.

Although this is a fictional story, the concept it presents holds to real-life marketing.

And this is exactly what a positioning strategy is for. Positioning aims to develop a key element that differentiates your medical brand. Your positioning is where your medical business stands **_in relation_** to other brands. It’s your unique position in the market.

But before we dive into the “how”, I want to drive home a concept many might find counterintuitive. And that is “focusing” on your brand.

## To focus or to defocus: is your practice focused enough?

{{% blockquote "Marty Neumeier" %}}An unfocused brand is one that’s so broad that it doesn’t stand for anything. A focused brand, by contrast, knows exactly what it is, why it’s different, and why people want it{{% /blockquote %}}

In his book, The Win Without Pitching Manifesto, author Blair Enns calls positioning “The Difficult Business Decision”.

And it makes sense.

Many when asked to focus their brand to serve specific kinds of people with specific kinds of offers, think it limits their outreach.

An example of focusing is being a practice that focuses on athletic injuries. It might sound restricting at first, After all, If we narrow our offering, won’t we narrow our profit opportunities?

Answer: Not necessarily.

History has shown that it pays handsomely to be number one in your category—first, because of higher margins, and second because the risk of commoditization is almost nonexistent.

The exact opposite of this is what we call brand dilution: when you try to be everything to everybody and windup like every other business. By being broad, you defocus your brand and leave it up to would-be patients to decide where to go.

If there are multiple care facilities, offering the same services, for the same patients, why should they choose you? Better equipment? Can be bought. Better quality care? Everybody claims so. Affordable? Well, you run the risk of participating in a race to the bottom.

Focusing your brand could be also about how you deliver your care and not the people you serve. Maybe you’re the most convenient care provider? Or your medical business is focused on same-day care and being the fastest service in your domain for busy people.

Focusing the brand to serve specific people with specific needs is what sets you apart and gives it clarity. It is a declaration of authority and expertise.

Now, with that out of the way, let’s dive into the strategy of how to go about differentiating your brand.

## Brand Differentiation Workshop

The goal of the Brand Differentiation Workshop is to single your brand out of the sea of sameness. We’re going to implement 3 exercises that will focus on finding AND highlighting your brand’s unique differentiator. A differentiator that sets you apart and can’t be easily mimicked.

This workshop strategy consists of 3 exercises:

* Audience Persona
* Differentiator Development
* Onliness Statement Development

## 1) Audience Persona Exercise ⏰ \[15-25 minute\]

  
Knowing your target audience lets you connect and align yourself with their needs. And for this, we’ll use audience persona exercise; Where we stress your ideal patients and their core characteristics.

The goal here is to get an overview of what makes your target audience tick. You’ll explore what they like, fear, and desire. Knowing this we’ll be key to finding a differentiator that matches their values.

But first, you need to decide on what type of patient you want to serve. If you’re a chiropractic, you might want to focus on athletes and gymnasts. Or maybe you’re a dental practitioner that likes working with children and finds them much easier to deal with? Or perhaps your target patients are mothers-to-be and your hospital helps them deliver babies.

If you don’t have a specific type of patient, just think of the people you want to help. They may vary from middle age moms or busy people with kids or influencers and image-aware people.

Once you find who you like and want to serve, move on to the next step.

### #\~ Plotting your audience characteristics:

![](/assets/images/4.png)  
The audience persona diagram consists of 4 quadrants:

1. **Goals:**
   * This quadrant will hold info about your patient’s goals and main aspires.
2. **Problems:**
   * This is where you plot your patient’s issues, problems, and what hinders them from achieving their goals. (NOTE: theses issues should relate to how you can solve them, more on that in a second)
3. **Impact**
   * Here is where you plot the consequences of the problems your patient has.
4. **Desires:**
   * What do they desire? What’s the perfect scenario they want when they visit you?

  
You and your team start answering the following questions with respect to their quadrant:

* For **goals**: What objectives they have as it relates to your offering?
* For **problems**: What are the problems your patient faces before they know you?
* For **Impact**: What do they fear because of those problems?
* For **Desires**: What’d be the desirable experience? What would be the best-case scenario after they get your treatment?

Use sticky notes and pin them to their respective quadrant.

Once you’ve done that, use a different color sticky note on the middle circle to describe your target audience in 1 or 2 short sentences.

The result should look like this:
