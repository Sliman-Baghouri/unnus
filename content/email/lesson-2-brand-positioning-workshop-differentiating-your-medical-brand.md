For the first time in history, competition does not come from your direct competitors, indeed, but from the market clutter.

According to research done by the Red Crown Marketing agency, It is estimated that the average person encounters between 6,000 to 10,000 ads daily. All from the same sounding brands, providing the same sounding offers with the same sounding voice.

This rushing flood of me-too brands forces our brains to deal with this clutter the best way it knows how—by blocking most of it out. And what’s left is the interesting, the inspiring, and the different.

Differentiation works because our cognitive system works. Our brains, to protect us from this vast amount of irrelevant information, learn to distinguish between the “lookalike” and the unique.

This way we only pay attention to what’s valuable and we don’t have to waste our time hearing the same marketing messages over and over.

And in this lesson, we’re going to find strategic ways for you to cut through the “me too” brands and highlight what’s unique about yours.

After this workshop, your brand won’t compete, but rather render the competition _irrelevant_.
