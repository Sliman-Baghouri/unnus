{{% hook %}} “People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe”—Simon Sinek {{% /hook %}}

***

The above quote holds the theme of this first lesson. People don’t care about any brand, but what they care about is the purposeful endeavor of said brand.

We have a cognitive bias towards meaningful brands. We vouch for their success, we stay loyal and spread the gospel about them. That’s because they reflect our beliefs and reinforce our core characteristics.

In this lesson, we’ll go through how you’ll infuse a dash of “meaningful substance” to your medical business and how that will lead you to attract cult-like followings and a loyal patient base.

My promise to you is that by the end of this lesson, you’ll have an unmatched advantage when it comes to running your medical business. An advantage that will make your practice a source of attraction and accelerate its growth trajectory.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. The fact about how patients choose medical practices
2. Why Messages Vs What Messages
3. Brand DNA workshop
   * Brand Golden Circle Exercise
   * Brand Credo Write-up
   * Brand Pillars Exercise
   * Future Brand Exercise
   * Brand Obituary Exercise
4. Next Steps

## Here’s a disturbing fact:

The degree of trust your patients feel towards your service, rather than the assessment of its features/benefit, will determine whether they’ll buy your service or the other services.

Why is that disturbing? Well, how many times you’ve heard the following marketing messages:

* “State of the art medical equipment.”
* “Data-driven approach to healthcare.”
* “Complete care suite of services.”
* “Cutting edge healthcare technology.”
* “Affordable healthcare costs.”

The problem with this kind of communication is that it assumes that the patient's choice is based on rationality and assessment of features, which is simply wrong. Again buying [decisions ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032808/)in such serious matters as our health are not rational but based on trust.

No one would choose a provider they don’t trust, even if they have the fanciest medical tech stack or cheapest price in town.

In his book, Start With The Why, Simon Sink refers to the above type of messages as a **What Message** (WM). A message that describes what the service is and its features.

What Messages are perceived by the neocortex, the part of the brain that’s responsible for logical thinking. For example, let’s say you’re in the process of buying a pen. A What Message (a message that emphasizes the features) will work great, and you’re probably going to assess the pen’s features before you buy it. That’s because the **decision size** is small, and trust isn’t needed that much to “lubricate” the sale.

However, when it comes to healthcare, the decision size is much bigger and trust is needed for patients to choose the provider.

In such serious matters, a more effective way of messaging is **Why Messages** (WYM): Messages that are trust-signaling and carry a high sense of purpose.

And because Why Messages are emotional and speak directly to our limbic system, the part of the brain that’s responsible for emotional responses, they are **10x** more impactful in attracting people.

## Brand DNA Workshop

Now we understand why purposeful brands attract loyal patients, let’s go into how you’ll infuse meaningful attributes to your medical brand.

In this workshop, we’ll go over the step-by-step process of how to transform your practice to be purpose-oriented. Brand DNA workshop consists of 4 branding exercises that focus on infusing purpose to your brand.

The goal here is to uncover your brand’s **Why** (the reason it exists) and _then_ articulate it in a novel manner. A manner that will resonate with your target patient.

You can conduct these exercises with your team online or on-site. I'll use the virtual aspect for the sake of convenience but it should be the same process in a physical location.

### Quick Prep:

We’re going to use virtual boards to run this workshop online. And the best tool I use with my clients is [miro](https://miro.com/). It’s an online tool that allows you to collaborate with your team on a virtual whiteboard. It offers handy features like sticky notes, voting dots, and meeting rooms.

First, you need to sign up for a free account and then [click here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lUESbeA=/) to access the branding exercises.

I made a quick video that explains how to use this tool:

## 1) Brand Golden Circle Exercise ⏰ \[15-25 minute\]

In this exercise we’ll brainstorm the following:

1. The **Why**:
   * The reason why your medical business exist and what’s the purpose behind it
2. The **How**:
   * How are you going to fulfill that reason or your brand’s end goal? And how will that benefit your patients?
3. The **What**:
   * What does your brand do? And how does that relate to your patients’ day-to-day life?

The end goal is to formulate the answers as a **Brand Credo,** a statement of the beliefs which guide your brand’s actions and communications.

Let’s start.

### #\~Step 1) brainstorming the Why:

![](/assets/images/5.png)

On the Why circle, you and your team try to think as to why the brand has come to fruition. What’s the purpose behind its existence and why should people care?

Take a couple of minutes to think and write down on sticky notes your answers. After that, pin the sticky notes to the Why circle.

Here’s a couple of questions to give you a headstart:

* Who are we helping?
* What are we helping them with?
* What Emotion do we want our target audience to have with the result we deliver?
* How could this emotion impact their lives?
* Does this have a knock-on effect elsewhere in their lives?
* How does this knock-on effect impact them practically?
* Based on what we do for our patients, what is the biggest impact we can have in their lives?

These questions will help you extract the essence of your brand. Make sure to avoid generic answers like “to treat people or to make people healthier”. Ask yourself, Who are the people I want to treat? And WHY do I want to treat them or/ make them healthier?

This will give you more interesting answers.

### #\~Step 2) brainstorming the How:

In this section, we look at how your brand is going to fulfill the purpose of its existence and how that can benefit your patients. And what’s the difference in the way you deliver care.

On the How Circle, brainstorm the ongoing commitments your brand has to do to achieve its higher purpose.

Here are questions to ask yourself and your team:

* How are we going to achieve our end objective? And What are the day-to-day commitments that enable us to reach our goal?
* What’s the difference in our method of delivering care?
* How could this benefit the patient?
* How can we implement an action plan for our commitments?

{{% note "Note" %}} you must be specific and actionable about the How. Avoid non-practical statements like “To provide patient-centric care” or “delivering personalized care”. Be specific as possible. 

For example: instead of saying “we provide convenient care”, try to be more elaborate like “we invest in the latest technology for faster healing and same-day care”. This way it’s more clear how you’re going to help the patient.{{% /note %}}

Remember, this process is internal for the moment. And expressing these attributes is the subject for an upcoming lesson. So, for now, you are free to write down what comes to your mind.

### #\~Step 3) brainstorming the What:

This is the easiest part of the exercise. Here, we try to lay down all of your services (or products) and their features. On the What Circle, write down descriptions of your brand and the answers to the following questions:

* What does our brand do?
* What are the features we provide to our patients?
* What are the things that we do or provide that other competitors don’t have?
* Describe your brand in 2 sentences
* Are there any perks or bonuses the patient gets out of being treated by us?

After you finished, your board will look like this:

Now that you have a strong idea of your brand, move on to the next exercise where you will consolidate your understanding.

## 2) Brand Credo Write-Up ⏰ \[15-25 minute\]

In this exercise, we aim to solidify our understanding of the brand’s golden circle. And we do this by writing a Brand Credo. A Brand Credo is a short statement that declares the philosophy and the principles that guide your brand.

From this credo, everything will branch out. Every communication, interaction, future decisions, projects, and partnerships, will be vetted against this credo. It will act as a filter to any aspect of your brand.

In the branding workshop, move onto the Brand Credo Exercise.

Each participant will have a blank paper where he or she can write down the credo. You can duplicate the papers for more people to use by selecting a paper then hold the Alt or ⌘ key while dragging it.

Here’s the basic template of a Brand Credo:

![](/assets/images/7.png)

Take 10-15 minutes and let the participant write their version of the credo. To help you write one here are some tips:

* In the first paragraph, write down why the brand exists. Go back to the Golden Circle and see the reasons behind the brand. It should give you an idea of what to write.
* In the second paragraph, write down how the brand is going to fulfill its promise. Here where you collect all of the How’s from the previous exercise and make a coherent statement
* The last paragraph is where you describe your brand and what it does. Keep it short and sweet.

{{% important %}} Your brand’s credo shouldn’t look like a generic and uninspiring mission statement. The Credo should be **different, powerful,** and **hard-hitting**. {{% /important %}}
