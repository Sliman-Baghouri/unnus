{{% hook %}} “People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe”—Simon Sinek {{% /hook %}}

***

The above quote holds the theme of this first lesson. People don’t care about any brand, but what they care about is the purposeful endeavor of said brand.

We have a cognitive bias towards meaningful brands. We vouch for their success, we stay loyal and spread the gospel about them. That’s because they reflect our beliefs and reinforce our core characteristics.

In this lesson, we’ll go through how you’ll infuse a dash of “meaningful substance” to your medical business and how that will lead you to attract cult-like followings and a loyal patient base.

My promise to you is that by the end of this lesson, you’ll have an unmatched advantage when it comes to running your medical business. An advantage that will make your practice a source of attraction and accelerate its growth trajectory.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

* The fact about how patients choose medical practices
* Why Messages Vs What Messages
* Brand DNA workshop
  * Brand Golden Circle Exercise
  * Brand Credo Write-up
  * Brand Pillars Exercise
  * Future Brand Exercise
  * Brand Obituary Exercise
* Next Steps

## Here’s a disturbing fact:

The degree of trust your patients feel towards your service, rather than the assessment of its features/benefit, will determine whether they’ll buy your service or the other services.

Why is that disturbing? Well, how many times you’ve heard the following marketing messages:

* “State of the art medical equipment.”
* “Data-driven approach to healthcare.”
* “Complete care suite of services.”
* “Cutting edge healthcare technology.”
* “Affordable healthcare costs.”

The problem with this kind of communication is that it assumes that the patient's choice is based on rationality and assessment of features, which is simply wrong. Again buying [decisions ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032808/)in such serious matters as our health are not rational but based on trust.

No one would choose a provider they don’t trust, even if they have the fanciest medical tech stack or cheapest price in town.

In his book, Start With The Why, Simon Sink refers to the above type of messages as a **What Message** (WM). A message that describes what the service is and its features.

What Messages are perceived by the neocortex, the part of the brain that’s responsible for logical thinking. For example, let’s say you’re in the process of buying a pen. A What Message (a message that emphasizes the features) will work great, and you’re probably going to assess the pen’s features before you buy it. That’s because the **decision size** is small, and trust isn’t needed that much to “lubricate” the sale.

However, when it comes to healthcare, the decision size is much bigger and trust is needed for patients to choose the provider.
