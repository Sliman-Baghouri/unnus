{{% hook %}}Today, people are not just choosing the best, the fanciest, or the cheapest. They‚Äôre choosing brands that have the right meaning. {{% /hook %}}

***

In the supermarkets, consumers are choosing to pay twice as much for eggs from humanely-treated cage-free chickens because of their values, not because it‚Äôs a better egg.

They do this because they don‚Äôt want to be the cause of any mistreatment of chickens (caged birds with their beaks clipped and all that).

They don‚Äôt want to support such practices with their dollars, and they don‚Äôt mind spending more dollars to do so. People are carefully considering the consequences of their actions, and they want brands to do the same.

When your patients connect to your brand that aligns with their most deeply-held beliefs and sense of identity, they are essentially both pulling that brand into their own world and entering the world of that brand.

People who are shopping for meaning are either drawn to that ethos and worldview or not. But if your brand truly represents an ethos and worldview that are attractive to your patients, they will not just patronize your brand, they will not just prefer you, they will not just be loyal to your brand, they will embrace that brand as part of their own identity.

So how do you go about creating such alignment of belief systems and sparking relationships with your target patient and your brand? Well, this is what we‚Äôll go through today.

This lesson covers:

1. Audience Identification and how it relates to your medical business
2. Humanizing your brand‚Äôs communication is key to break through today‚Äôs digital noise
3. Brand Persona Workshop
   * Brand Archetypal Mix Exercise
   * Brand Commitment Matrix
   * Brand Voice Exercise
   * Brand Tone Projection Exercise
   * Brand Interview Exercise
4. What‚Äôs next

Let‚Äôs dive right ahead.

## Do patients identify with you?

It seems that many of us in the post-modern industrialized world have moved beyond the primal needs of survival and safety‚Äîand are focused more on the higher needs of esteem and self-actualization.

Today, people want to belong to something bigger than themselves. People want to stand for something that matters. People want to champion good over evil. People want to do the right thing.

Therefore brands aren‚Äôt just about the product or service they provide, but the meaning they represent, which people are using, in turn, to represent themselves.

Think of the owner of a Toyota Prius who wears eco-friendly Nau clothing, buys fair-trade coffee at Whole Foods, carries a Prada bag, and wears blood-free diamonds from Tiffany‚Äôs. This person is borrowing the meaning from these brands to tell a story about herself that ranges from her commitment to social responsibility to her love of quality and dedication to style.

If she chose different brands, even if they offered the same quality level but did not represent her social consciousness, she would be telling a different story about herself. She would be, in effect, representing a different person.

This means that people are choosing brands as a way to self-identify themselves and communicate their values to the world. For example, If your target patients are environmentally-conscious people, it makes sense that your brand displays the quality of cleanliness and eco-friendliness. Eco-friendly people will choose eco-friendly brands because it reinforces their values and reflects their core attributes.

And if you‚Äôre in the cosmetic care services, your audience is image-aware people (think celebrities, politicians, models..) they will choose brands that display the same values they hold (confidence, certitude, elegance).

This way there‚Äôs a match of values and purchase decisions are almost automatic.

So, how do you go about creating this ‚Äúmatch‚Äù between your medical brand and its audience? How do you set the stage for your brand in order for patients to identify with it? This will be the subject of the first exercise in today‚Äôs lesson.

But first, let‚Äôs tackle another critical yet easily missed aspect of your brand.

## How humane is your medical brand?

Due to the rapid boom of technology, we‚Äôre bombarded with repetitive automated messages, answering machines, and uninspiring robotic offerings. Algorithms dictate what messages we see and the way we see them. And the only human-like touch we‚Äôre left with is the artificial attempt of personalization: ‚ÄúHi {{Name}}‚Äù.

Not only that, but because of the quick surge of look-alike brands, we‚Äôre seeing more and more of this drab and lackluster communication.

We‚Äôre now soaked in ‚Äúdigital noise‚Äù which left us yearning for the slightest human experience and personalized messages. And the need for a new way of communication is acute.

Today I‚Äôll share with you a creative strategy to ‚Äúhumanize‚Äù your medical brand and infuse humanistic flair into its communication. We‚Äôre going to create a unique ‚Äúvoice‚Äù and manner of messaging that will tighten the connections your patient segment has with your brand.

## Brand Persona Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to solve the two critical points we discussed above: **1)** How to create a medical brand that people will deeply identify with and **2)** how to inject humanistic attributes into your brand‚Äôs communication for a stronger affinity and engagement.

The workshop consists of 5 exercises:

* Brand Archetypal Mix
* Brand Commitment Matrix
* Brand Voice
* Brand Tone Projection
* Brand Interview

So without wasting time, let‚Äôs start our workshop.

## 1) Brand Archetypal Mix Exercise ‚è∞ \[15-25 minute\]

To create a match between your brand‚Äôs traits and your target audience‚Äôs beliefs, we need to visit a concept coined by psychologist Carl Jung, and that is Archetypes.

An archetype is a typical character that represents universal patterns of human nature. These characters represent our core desires and aspirations. According to Jung, there are twelve archetypes:

Archetypes, Jung suggested, were inborn tendencies that play a role in influencing human behavior. Archetypes are widely used in books, movies, and branding. For example, Yoda is the **Sage** in Star Wars. Indiana Jones is the **Explorer**, and Maximus is the **Hero** in the Gladiator.

As you can see, each one of us has core desires and an archetype that represents them.

  
And in this exercise, we‚Äôll try to pick an archetype and _assign_ it to your brand. But, the trick here is to first identify your audience‚Äôs archetype, THEN, assign an archetype to your brand that would most appeal to them.

For example, let's say that your target patients are pregnant women and your hospital helps deliver babies. Your patients (mothers-to-be) archetype will be **the caregiver** (an archetype that is driven by the desire to protect and care for their children)

So, your brand‚Äôs archetype can be also a **caregiver**: meaning, your brand‚Äôs communication, and behaviors will carry characteristics of the caregiver archetype like soft-spoken messages/reassuring and supportive.

This way there‚Äôs a harmony between your patient-base‚Äôs archetype and your brand‚Äôs.

But you don‚Äôt always have to mimic your audience‚Äôs archetype. For example, If your patients desire power (the Ruler), it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that your brand should choose the Ruler archetype.

And that‚Äôs because if your medical brand is providing them with some kind of education, to help them get that power, then they're likely to be drawn to the **Sage** personality that demonstrates wisdom and knowledge.

A good rule of thumb is to have two archetypes for your brand. The first one will represent 70% of the brand and the second will represent 30% of it. The first one will be the prominent archetype and is what your audience will resonate with, and the second one to break the mold and differentiate the brand.

We‚Äôll go over some examples to further illustrate these concepts, but now let‚Äôs see how to define your brand archetypes.

### üî¥ Action Step: Define your archetypal mix:

On the brand archetype wheel, identify the core desires of your target audience, and based on that, think about what role your brand plays in their lives.

To define your brand archetype, follow the next steps:

* Discuss with your team what are the core desires of your target patients and how it relates to their problems.
* Use sticky notes to write down the archetypal mix percentage of your brand (ex: 70% Sage, 30% Caregiver) based on their desire.
* Each participant should pin their answers to the quadrant and start the voting
* Use the red voting dots on the right to decide on the best suitable mix for your brand. The highest voted answer is the winner.

When you are deciding on an archetype try to ask yourself ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the ulterior motive for our patient to visit us?‚Äù Try to dig deeper to pinpoint the reason for patients to get treated by you. For example, if you're a cosmetic dental practice, don‚Äôt settle for answers like ‚Äúto fix their crooked teeth‚Äù. Crooked teeth are the surface-level cause. What the patient desires are to eradicate self-consciousness and be more confident in their dental appearance.

Once you know the desire, pick an archetype that fits it.

After you and your team are happy with your archetypal mix, move on to the next exercise.
