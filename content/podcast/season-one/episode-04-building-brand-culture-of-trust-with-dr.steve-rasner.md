Steven:

People are getting to know you, people are looking at your videos, your stories and your photos and they're already liking you before they even come in to see you.

Sliman:

Hello and welcome to the Care Frontiers podcast today, we have a very special guest with me, Dr. Teffani Long. Dr. Teffani is the owner of Epic Dental Arts Practice. The practice is located in Oregon Forest Groove. Albeit not a very good year, 2020 marks the 20th year anniversary for Dr. Teffani as a dentist. She bought her first dental practice, sold it, and then purchased another one in 2019. Dr. Teffani, welcome to our show. 

Steven:

Hello. Thank you for having me. 

Sliman: 

So to jump right in to our questions, I'm really curious, what led you to be a dentist as opposed to  other fields of healthcare?
