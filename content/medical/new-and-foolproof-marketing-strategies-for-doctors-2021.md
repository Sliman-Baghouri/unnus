An overabundance of “me too” care services and DIY products are commoditizing the healthcare industry. And as of 2021, the competition is surging faster than it ever has been. For these reasons and many others, not having a unique personal brand is the same as being invisible.

### #\~So, What is a Personal Brand Strategy?

Personal Brand Strategy is a strategy that is focused on positioning you as an authority in your field and highlighting your unique attributes. The goal is to establish a grounded and differentiated brand for you or your practice.

### #\~Common Myths about Personal Branding

#### Myth 1: Personal branding is about creating fake personage

Having a personal brand is not about creating a manufactured image or inauthentic persona, indeed, personal branding cuts through the lookalike and provides you with unfair advantages over your peers. It adds your personal touch on how you deliver care and distinguish you from the rest.

#### Myth 2: You have to be popular to have a personal brand

A common misconception is that by building **brand awareness** (expanding your sphere of influence) you can form a brand, however, being “well-known” is partial to what makes up a brand. You can be popular, but brandless-ly so.

Building a personal brand is not about harvesting social media followers and tracking vanity metrics. Your brand is not tied to how many people know you but to _what makes you different._

### #\~Benefits of a Personal Brand Strategy:

* Having a personal brand creates an unbreachable wall against the competition
* Having a strong brand reduces your marketing expenses: When you have recognized a brand, you’re less dependent on marketing and you can cut the costs of ads/promotional efforts.
* It attracts high-value patients
* Skyrockets your practice growth and profitability
* Makes your care services premium and modern

## 2) Storytelling strategy

Imagine what you want to say to your ideal patient goes through intact - crystal clear and potent? **What if your messages are perceived straight into people's brains without distortion, noise, or the need to think too much about it?** Brand Storytelling Strategy shrinks the "psychic distance” between your medical business and your ideal patient so that a relationship can begin to develop.

  
These gap-crossing, distance-shrinking messages are the building blocks of a great storytelling campaign.

**Brand Storytelling** is a strategy used to communicate with your target patient in a novel, digestible, and more trustworthy way. The strategy focuses on creating inspiring stories around your practice, its services, and your patients.

**Best part?** You don’t need a massive budget or film studio for it to work. Here at unnus, we developed this strategy to make it as attainable as it can be.
