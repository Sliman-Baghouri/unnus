## What to do _before_ marketing your audiology practice

More often than not, audiology promotional efforts fall flat because there was no grounded bedrock for the marketing to stand on. Let’s go through critical aspects that need to be addressed before you start marketing your practice.

## Hone in on the service and separate yourself from the device

With the rapid surge of competition from retail titans, hearing equipment has become a commodity. Patients’ accessibility to such devices has increased to a point where anyone can get their hand on hearing aids from their mobile phone.

A mistake often practitioners fall into is trying to attract patients using these commoditized products as their selling point. “Why would I go to an audiologist if I can get the same product shipped to my home in a matter of hours?” is the question you should refute.

The refutation in this competitive environment lies within the **service** you provide. Instead of focusing on the products, you should focus more on creating memorable service to your patients, a service that no device or retail store can afford to provide.

Focusing on the care service instead of the device is the first step to singling yourself out from the sea of sameness. This will give patients new reasons as to **why** they should come to you.

## Differentiate, Differentiate, Differentiate

Differentiation works because of how our brains function. Our brain filters the “lookalike” and tends to pay attention to what’s different as a way to protect us from the plethora of irrelevant information.

A common misconception about differentiation is that you have to provide radically new service to be different. However, this could not be further from the truth. You can provide the same care service and still be different. Differentiation comes in a lot of ways:

* You can be different in terms of language and one voice
* Aesthetics and visuals
* Personality
* Processes and the way you deliver the care; And
* Other 1000s of unexplored aspects that you can take advantage of.

## Build Your Brand

Your marketing is as good as the brand behind it. Marketing should support and build the brand while communicating its defining attributes. A common myth about branding is that by being popular or famous (increasing brand awareness) you’ll form a brand.

Branding is not about being “known” or influential. Being in the minds of many people is partial to what makes up a brand. A brand is what people **feel** towards your practice and how they perceive it. When enough individuals arrive at the same feeling, you’ll form a brand.

{{% blockquote "Marty Neumeier" %}} A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service, or company. It's a GUT FEELING because we're all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational. {{% /blockquote %}}

That “feeling” is measured by the **brand preference** metric.

Brand preference is a cognitive judgment a patient makes regarding your brand. It measures to which extent purchasing decisions are made based on the attachment and loyalty to your brand rather than the price, convenience, or regardless of the alternatives.

Branding your practice will skyrocket referral rates, patient retention, and acquisition. More importantly, it’ll maximize your marketing efforts and lead to unmatched results.

Building your brand consists of five stages:

* Brand DNA
* Brand Differentiation Strategy
* Brand Persona
* Brand Storytelling
* Art Direction

## Audiology marketing ideas

Now that we have the 3 pillars of a successful audiology marketing campaign, let’s dive into the strategies.

## Generate patients using Google Adwords

Imagine someone typing “audiologist near me” and your office contact information, booking page, and directions comes up first on google search in front of thousands of people?

That’s exactly what Google Adwords is for. It’s an auction-based platform that allows you to pay to be on the top of google search results.

**Best part?** These searchers are warm leads. Meaning, they are already looking for hearing doctors and want to contact you. Unlike cold leads, where people are not actively looking for care, in google AdWords, people want to be in your office. You just need to show up.

Showing up on the first page of Google for these terms are ridiculously cheaper than traditional media. For example, if you offer a hearing aid for $2500 per patient. And you spend $550 a month on Google Adwords to get 2 patients, your profit will be $4450, that’s 809% ROI.

## Using video advertising to raise awareness

According to recent research, viewers [retain 95% of a message ](https://www.insivia.com/50-must-know-stats-about-video-animation-marketing-2013/)when they watch it in a video, compared to 10% when reading it in text.

So, although, making a video is a little more expensive than a normal ad, the results are well worth it. Since you’re guaranteed a high retention rate for your video ad (if it’s well made), that means you’re more likely to get higher ROI on your advertisement spend on video marketing platforms like Youtube than a text-based one.

## Attract patient using social media targeting ads

Another great strategy for you is to target your ideal patients using social media advertising platforms like Facebook Ads. A platform like Facebook Ads allows you to reach a huge audience for the price of 1/10th of what you’ll have to pay to achieve the same exposure on TV.

Not only that but these audiences are highly targeted, meaning you can be in front of your ideal patients, at the ideal time, offering them the ideal treatment plan.

Here’s an example of audiology Facebook ads:
