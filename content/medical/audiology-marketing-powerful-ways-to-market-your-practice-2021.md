## What to do _before_ marketing your audiology practice

More often than not, audiology promotional efforts fall flat because there was no grounded bedrock for the marketing to stand on. Let’s go through critical aspects that need to be addressed before you start marketing your practice.

## Hone in on the service and separate yourself from the device

With the rapid surge of competition from retail titans, hearing equipment has become a commodity. Patients’ accessibility to such devices has increased to a point where anyone can get their hand on hearing aids from their mobile phone.

A mistake often practitioners fall into is trying to attract patients using these commoditized products as their selling point. “Why would I go to an audiologist if I can get the same product shipped to my home in a matter of hours?” is the question you should refute.

The refutation in this competitive environment lies within the **service** you provide. Instead of focusing on the products, you should focus more on creating memorable service to your patients, a service that no device or retail store can afford to provide.

Focusing on the care service instead of the device is the first step to singling yourself out from the sea of sameness. This will give patients new reasons as to **why** they should come to you.

## Differentiate, Differentiate, Differentiate

Differentiation works because of how our brains function. Our brain filters the “lookalike” and tends to pay attention to what’s different as a way to protect us from the plethora of irrelevant information.

A common misconception about differentiation is that you have to provide radically new service to be different. However, this could not be further from the truth. You can provide the same care service and still be different. Differentiation comes in a lot of ways:

* You can be different in terms of language and one voice
* Aesthetics and visuals
* Personality
* Processes and the way you deliver the care; And
* Other 1000s of unexplored aspects that you can take advantage of.

## Build Your Brand

Your marketing is as good as the brand behind it. Marketing should support and build the brand while communicating its defining attributes. A common myth about branding is that by being popular or famous (increasing brand awareness) you’ll form a brand.

Branding is not about being “known” or influential. Being in the minds of many people is partial to what makes up a brand. A brand is what people **feel** towards your practice and how they perceive it. When enough individuals arrive at the same feeling, you’ll form a brand.

{{% blockquote "Marty Neumeier" %}} A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service, or company. It's a GUT FEELING because we're all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational. {{% /blockquote %}}

That “feeling” is measured by the **brand preference** metric.

Brand preference is a cognitive judgment a patient makes regarding your brand. It measures to which extent purchasing decisions are made based on the attachment and loyalty to your brand rather than the price, convenience, or regardless of the alternatives.

Branding your practice will skyrocket referral rates, patient retention, and acquisition. More importantly, it’ll maximize your marketing efforts and lead to unmatched results.

Building your brand consists of five stages:

* Brand DNA
* Brand Differentiation Strategy
* Brand Persona
* Brand Storytelling
* Art Direction
