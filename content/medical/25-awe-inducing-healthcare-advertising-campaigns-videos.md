Today’s advertising is not the “pale, 20% off, on sale now” kind of cringefest you’re used to encountering.

Ads now are empowered by meaningful [branding](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/) that inspires, entertain, and build a cult-like following to your healthcare brand.

In this article, I’ll share with you 25 mesmerizing healthcare advertising campaigns. I’ll also explain why these campaigns are great and worth taking notes from.

In addition, I’ll reference what is the **brand voice** used in said campaigns.

**Brand voice** is the tone and language used when communicating your brand’s message, ads, marketing, website copy, or when talking with your patient.

These ads we will discuss today are:

1. Hospital adverts examples
2. Insurance ad campaign examples
3. Health product advertisement examples
4. Pharma ads examples
5. Other Medical adverts

Let’s start.

## Hospital adverts examples

### 1) “You’re freaking us out” by One Medical

![healthcare-commercial-examples-1](/assets/images/medical-advert-1.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-1")**What’s great about it:** Instead of the usual advice “Masks are good for your safety”, One Medical took a different approach to raise the importance of wearing masks against Covid-19. This depicts a “seemingly menacing” lumberjack chasing the “seemingly normal” person. The plot twist is that the lumberjack was the one who was running _from_ the normal person. It is a brilliant idea that conveys even the scariest people are afraid of the unintentional harm a person without a mask can cause.

**Its Brand Voice:** Playful, Clever, and truthful.

### 2) “Redefining Possible” by UCSF Medical Center

![healthcare-commercial-examples-2](/assets/images/medical-advert-2.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-2")**What’s great about it:** Unlike other medical centers, UCSF didn’t take the approach of “best quality care” claim. They provide quality care, but it’s not their mission. Their mission is to redefine what’s possible and take on harder challenges. This bold statement solidifies its unique position in healthcare as **a daring health institution**.

**Its Brand Voice:** Bold, Daring, and heroic.

### 3) “Life-defining moments” by Getinge

  
![healthcare-commercial-examples-3](/assets/images/medical-advert-3.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-3")

**What’s great about it:** In the conservative MedTech industry, not many attempts to challenge the traditional norms of communication. But in their new campaign, highlighting groundbreaking ventilator technology. In this campaign, we follow a neonatologist delivering a baby at a hospital.

In a series of clips, going backward in time, we see the doctor as she gets younger. We hear her gasping for breath while exercising, cheering for joy at her graduation, and breathing nervously as she awaits her wedding ceremony.

**Its Brand Voice:** Stirring, Passionate, and Thought-provoking.

### 4) “SickKids goes All In” by SickKids Hospital for Sick Children

![healthcare-commercial-examples-4](/assets/images/medical-advert-4.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-4")

**What’s great about it**: Each year, hundreds of charities go head-to-head to attract donations. SickKids needed to unite the city to get behind their cause. Building on their past success, they have to strike while the iron is hot.

  
Toronto is called the city of neighborhoods. To succeed, they need to unite them all behind the new hospital and for that, they rallied every single neighborhood in Toronto to take up arms in the fight for a new hospital. They answered the call.

Taking it to the streets, with larger-than-life murals of patients rallying their loved ones to join at fundthefight.ca. As donors provided funds, their digital flags were proudly planted on a virtual map of the city.

**Its Brand Voice**: Valiant, Harmonic, and Tenacious.

### 5) “Long Live Little Brats” by the Montreal Children’s Hospital

![healthcare-commercial-examples-5](/assets/images/medical-advert-5.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-5")

**What’s great about it**: As the province is a very competitive market for children’s charities, the difficult task was to break through the volume and attract donors.

The Children's team knows this well: a healthy child can be energetic, unruly, and sometimes a little bratty. The first indicator that your kid is feeling under the weather is often when she or he becomes much quieter and calmer than usual.

The centerpiece of the campaign is a long-form film that tells the story of one such little brat and echoes the little girl’s unapologetically wild and mischievous nature.

**Its Brand Voice**: Unrepentant, Spontaneous, and Unexpected.

### 6) “So Much Better” by Baylor Scott & White Health

  
![healthcare-commercial-examples-6](/assets/images/medical-advert-6.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-6")

**What’s great about it:** The challenge most healthcare advertising faces is that all ads look like other healthcare advertising. The TV commercials often show the usual suspects: Doctors, nurses, and patients all inside the hospital. This ad took a different route: Since Baylor Scott & White Health is focused on making people better so they can live a better life, they set out to create advertising that feels, looks, and sounds better, too.

The commercial depicts Baylor Scott & White Health’s better solution for invasive heart surgery. Jay is now back on his feet and feeling so much better.

**Its Brand Voice**: Optimistic, Confident, and Reassuring.

### 7) “Care Bravely” by Lifebridge health

  
![healthcare-commercial-examples-4](/assets/images/medical-advert-7.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-4")

**What’s great about it:** This ad features a young girl seen walking through a dark and menacing forest, throughout the film’s dark backdrop, she narrates her reality that for her “monsters” do exist.

During her walk, she suddenly pauses when she discovers a golden crown shining brightly amongst the tree branches. As her backdrop fades away, it is revealed that she’s a young cancer patient inside a LifeBridge Health Hospital.

The hospital nurse is then shown, bringing a warm, inviting, and much needed comforting presence. She places a paper crown on the young girl’s head and they embrace each other.

### 8) “Unstoppable” by Brookdale Hospital

  
![healthcare-commercial-examples-8](/assets/images/medical-advert-8.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-8")

**What’s great about it:** The Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center is a nonprofit medical services provider working on the frontline against Covid-19 in Brooklyn, New York.

The doctors and nurses who work there are fighting a daily battle on the frontline to save people’s lives whilst putting their own at risk. So they embarked on a 60s script that would honor their sacrifice and hard work, epitomizing their tenacity.

### 9) “Home For Christmas” by Great Ormond Street Hospital

![healthcare commercial examples 9](/assets/images/medical-advert-9.jpg "healthcare commercial examples 9")  
**What’s great about it:** Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity released an animated Christmas campaign that charts a patient's journey home for the festive period.

The ad features patient Mia and her sister Amy. Both were treated at hospital years apart for the same rare condition. In this animated segment, Mia falls asleep in her room, which is adorned with festive decorations. A wind carries her and other sleeping children away from the hospital on their journeys home. It ends with a real home clip of Mia and Amy running downstairs in their matching pajamas.
