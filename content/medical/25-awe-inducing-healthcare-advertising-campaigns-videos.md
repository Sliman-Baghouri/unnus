Today’s advertising is not the “pale, 20% off, on sale now” kind of cringefest you’re used to encountering.

Ads now are empowered by meaningful [branding](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/) that inspires, entertain, and build a cult-like following to your healthcare brand.

In this article, I’ll share with you 25 mesmerizing healthcare advertising campaigns. I’ll also explain why these campaigns are great and worth taking notes from.

In addition, I’ll reference what is the **brand voice** used in said campaigns.

**Brand voice** is the tone and language used when communicating your brand’s message, ads, marketing, website copy, or when talking with your patient.

These ads we will discuss today are:

1. Hospital adverts examples
2. Insurance ad campaign examples
3. Health product advertisement examples
4. Pharma ads examples
5. Other Medical adverts

Let’s start.

## Hospital adverts examples

### 1) “You’re freaking us out” by One Medical

![healthcare-commercial-examples-1](/assets/images/medical-advert-1.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-1")**What’s great about it:** Instead of the usual advice “Masks are good for your safety”, One Medical took a different approach to raise the importance of wearing masks against Covid-19. This depicts a “seemingly menacing” lumberjack chasing the “seemingly normal” person. The plot twist is that the lumberjack was the one who was running _from_ the normal person. It is a brilliant idea that conveys even the scariest people are afraid of the unintentional harm a person without a mask can cause.

**Its Brand Voice:** Playful, Clever, and truthful.

### 2) “Redefining Possible” by UCSF Medical Center

![healthcare-commercial-examples-2](/assets/images/medical-advert-2.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-2")**What’s great about it:** Unlike other medical centers, UCSF didn’t take the approach of “best quality care” claim. They provide quality care, but it’s not their mission. Their mission is to redefine what’s possible and take on harder challenges. This bold statement solidifies its unique position in healthcare as **a daring health institution**.

**Its Brand Voice:** Bold, Daring, and heroic.

### 3) “Life-defining moments” by Getinge

  
![healthcare-commercial-examples-3](/assets/images/medical-advert-3.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-3")

**What’s great about it:** In the conservative MedTech industry, not many attempts to challenge the traditional norms of communication. But in their new campaign, highlighting groundbreaking ventilator technology. In this campaign, we follow a neonatologist delivering a baby at a hospital.

In a series of clips, going backward in time, we see the doctor as she gets younger. We hear her gasping for breath while exercising, cheering for joy at her graduation, and breathing nervously as she awaits her wedding ceremony.

**Its Brand Voice:** Stirring, Passionate, and Thought-provoking.

**4)** “**SickKids goes All In” by SickKids Hospital for Sick Children**

![healthcare-commercial-examples-4](/assets/images/medical-advert-4.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-4")

**What’s great about it**: Each year, hundreds of charities go head-to-head to attract donations. SickKids needed to unite the city to get behind their cause. Building on their past success, they have to strike while the iron is hot.  
Toronto is called the city of neighborhoods. To succeed, they need to unite them all behind the new hospital and for that, they rallied every single neighborhood in Toronto to take up arms in the fight for a new hospital. They answered the call.

Taking it to the streets, with larger-than-life murals of patients rallying their loved ones to join at fundthefight.ca. As donors provided funds, their digital flags were proudly planted on a virtual map of the city.
