Today’s advertising is not the “pale, 20% off, on sale now” kind of cringefest you’re used to encountering.

Ads now are empowered by meaningful [branding](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/) that inspires, entertain, and build a cult-like following to your healthcare brand.

In this article, I’ll share with you 25 mesmerizing healthcare advertising campaigns. I’ll also explain why these campaigns are great and worth taking notes from.

In addition, I’ll reference what is the **brand voice** used in said campaigns.

**Brand voice** is the tone and language used when communicating your brand’s message, ads, marketing, website copy, or when talking with your patient.

These ads we will discuss today are:

1. Hospital adverts examples
2. Insurance ad campaign examples
3. Health product advertisement examples
4. Pharma ads examples
5. Other Medical adverts

Let’s start.
