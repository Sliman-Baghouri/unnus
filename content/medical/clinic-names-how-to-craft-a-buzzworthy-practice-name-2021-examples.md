_Why are there so many sound-alike names?_

The short answer is simple: Most good names are taken. Plus, it’s always easier for practice owners to copy what’s already out there than using their genuine creative formulation.

A disregard for the practice name will submerge your brand into a sea of lookalikes and incur future bottlenecks for your medical business.

In contrast, a great name will accelerate the success of your brand and provide patients with razor-sharp **clarity** about what you do and _why_ your medical brand is different.

My promise to you is that, by the end of this article, I’ll provide you with the key elements that make for a timeless brand name and a step-by-step process to help you craft a buzzworthy name. I will also share with you examples to inspire your creativity.

## Can a name do all that?

If you’re about to open a new medical business, be it a practice, clinic, hospital, or even if you’re planning on rebranding your organization, you must know the unmatched perks of a great brand name.

[77% of consumers](https://business.time.com/2012/11/01/brand-names-just-dont-mean-as-much-anymore/) purchase items based on their brand name and 71% of consumers are more likely to buy a service from a [name they ](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/71-of-consumers-more-likely-to-buy-a-product-or-service-from-a-name-they-recognise/)recognize.

The right name can be a brand’s most valuable property, driving differentiation and accelerating acceptance. The wrong name can cause thousands, even millions, of workarounds and lost revenue over the long-term.

{{% blockquote "Marty Neumeier" %}}An example of a great name is Carl Zeiss, the maker of optical lenses. Does Zeiss make great lenses? Who knows? But the name makes the lenses “sound” great. The word “Zeiss” has hints of “glass” and “precise,” and evokes thoughts of German technological superiority{{% /blockquote %}}

Another good example is Smuckers, The jam manufacturer company. The name benefits strongly from onomatopoeia. “Smuckers” sounds like smacking lips, a preverbal testament to a yummy jam. The name is also unique, short, spellable, pronounceable, likable, portable, and legally-defensible.

As we can see, a great name radically increases the memorability of your medical business in the minds of patients. It can provide a vivid picture of everything you stand for and the values you hold.

## How NOT to name your medical brand

Before we get to name your brand, let’s explore some pitfalls so you can dodge the bullet.

### Avoid location-based names

As of 2021, every city almost always has a medical practice named after it. You’ve seen it, SouthPark Care, Chicago Dental, NYC medical Center, London Audiology, and Sydney Chiropractic. While the logic behind this sort of naming is understandable, it’s insufficient in today’s age. If you head over google maps and type a city + category of medical business, you’re guaranteed to find at least 2 identical practice names.

Not only that, but these names are low on imagery and hard to distinguish from the endless City+Category names. You want your patient to associate your practice with a feeling, experience, or a differentiator. What you don’t want is making them confused, distracted, or forget you altogether.

### Is your medical business’s name predictable?

Let me guess the name of dental practices within a fifty-mile radius of where you live. Smile Dental? Tooth Dental Clinic? Aesthetic Dental Care? You get my point. These names are so much alike you wonder why people choose business names to create distinction.

In healthcare, names are particularly predictable and same sounding. But, don’t we want to be straightforward and predictable so patients know what we do? Instead of being clever and unclear? Well, Not necessarily.

The founders of Yubop were turned down when they first proposed the name. As one investor said, “It just doesn’t sound like a serious company.” Yet, they decided to go forward with it.

5 years later, Yubop is a household word. The tagline “Who bop?” has become a viral catchphrase in marketing, with customers using it in their everyday talk.

And word of mouth is now so strong that the company’s advertising budget is significantly lower than average, while profit margins are higher.

## The 7 pillars of a great medical brand name

let’s dive right into the 7 pillars of a great medical brand name.

### 1) Distinctiveness: Is your name different enough?

A great name should be differentiated from names in its class. Your brand name must hold unique characteristics that no other names can easily copy. Your practice name should not be predictable or sound like a derivative of other names.

### 2) Brevity: The shorter the better

Is it short enough for people to remember it? If it’s a multi-word name, it runs the risk of being forgotten or shortened to non-comprehensible letters. Aim for it to be as brief as it can reasonably be. No one wants

### 3) Appropriateness: Does it fit well?

Does it fit well with the purpose of your medical business? Is it reflecting what you do? or hint at it? A good name should convey a message about the practice and its differentiator. If it works just as well for any other business, it isn’t the one.

### 4) Easy Spelling And Pronunciation

Can people easily spell it after hearing it spoken? Is it just as easy to pronounce after reading it? Spelling the name should not turn into a spelling bee or make people feel ignorant. Keep it simple and sweet.

### 5) Likability: Will people enjoy it?

Will people enjoy using it? Names that have a “mouth feel” or an “earworm” sounding pronunciation will have advantages over other names that don’t.

### 6) Extendibility: how flexible is it?

Does the name hint at an imagery depiction? Can you visualize it as a physical object? Is it easily used in other contexts and can it be juggled around? If your name isn’t easy to use for wordplay, keep looking.

### 7) Protectability: how safe is it to use?

Can your name be easily defensible? How about its URL availability? Can you trademark it? A Good name is easy to protect and will be safer to use in the long term.
