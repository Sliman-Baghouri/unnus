<section  id="Intro"> <div class="hook"> <p>It’s terrifying research. </p><p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/life-sciences-and-health-care/articles/great-consolidation-health-systems.html">50% of the current hospital systems</a> will not exist in the next 10 years. Meaning, mediocre hospitals are to drop like flies in the following decade.</p> <hr> </div> <p>You see, that’s not surprising in the slightest.</p>

<p>When the number of choices patients face keep growing; when your staff takes refuge in functional silos instead of a collaborative ecosystem; when you face the jagged transition to value-based care; when the market dynamics changes before you adapt; when patient retention dwindles down;or when your hospital is swimming in a sameness-sea of “me too” hospitals, it’s no surprise half of the current health systems will vanish.</p>

<p>So, how will you cut through these hurdles?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: Implement a hospital branding strategy.</p>

<section id="WhatHospitalbrandisnot">

<h2>First, what hospital brand is not?</h2>
<p>
  Let’s first define what brand and branding are not so we can leave room for the truth.
</p>

<p>A brand is not your hospital logo, it’s not visual designs or ads. It’s not marketing effort, collateral, or business graphics and it is not a product.<p>
<p>
Some people say a “brand is a promise” there’s some truth in that, but that’s not what it is. 
</p>
</section>
<section id="what is a hospital brand?">

<h2>So, what <em>is</em> a hospital brand?</h2>
<p>
A hospital brand is your customer GUT FEELING about your healthcare organization or care services.</p>
<p>By customers I mean, patients, patients' families, and visitors referring physicians, doctors' offices, blood donors, staff, and third-party payers.</p>
<p>
It's a GUT FEELING because people are emotional, intuitive beings.
</p>

<p>

And because we make decisions according to our trust in the care service.

</p>
<p>

The gut feeling your customers has about your hospital is a direct result of the following:  

</p>
<ul>
<li>The perception they hold about your hospital in relation to your competitors</li>
<li>What makes you different, RADICALLY different.</li>
<li>The end-to-end experiences they have with your hospital.</li>  
<li>The communications they receive from your brand.</li>
<li>The reputation and trust you build during a period of time; And</li>
<li>The culture you create inside your organization.</li>
 </ul>
  
<p>This is good research, however, <a href="#">defaults should be he states</a>.</p>
<p> Is your hospital reliable or luxurious? industry-leading or Innovative ?</p>
  
<p>Or does your hospital stand for something unique? If it does, are you vocal about it?
</p>
<section id="Whatisahospitalbrandingstrategy">
<p>A hospital branding strategy is the management of the components that make your hospital unique.</p>
<p>

Meaning, it’s about creating perceptions and fostering organization culture.

</p>

<p>

And It’s about deciding on a communication strategy, building trust, and differentiating your hospital from the lookalike brands. 

</p>

<p>Branding your hospital is about bringing clarity and painting a vivid picture for the future. </p>

<p>
It’s like developing a vaccine against: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unpredictable future challenges</li>
  <li>Uncollaborative hospital environment</li>
  <li>Market clutter and cutthroat competition</li>
  <li>Financial pressure; And</li>
  <li>Unsavory reputation</li>
</ul>

<section id="Perksofhavinganestablishedhospitalbrand">

<h2>Perks of having an established hospital brand </h2>

<p>

There are immeasurable advantages to having a concrete brand in place. 

</p>

<p>

I’ll name a few for the sake of brevity.

</p>
<h3>I) Branding your hospital renders your competition irrelevant
</h3>
<p>

Our brains are wired to notice what’s different. That’s because we need to maintain our sanity. 

</p>

<p>

Would-be patients encounter between <a href="#"> 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day</a>. 

</p>

<p>

And for our brain to “filter out the clutter”, we skip past “look alikes” to pay attention to what’s unique. 

</p>

<p>

Which means you’ll no longer need to compete on price, acquisitions, or volume. 

</p>

 <p>You are at the center of the stage.</p>
<h3>II) Branding creates cult-like loyalty to your hospital</h3>
<blockquote>

People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.

</blockquote>
  
  <p>

Yes, fraud possibly occurred but this also happened 1000x over in companies throughout history all over the world. This is again referring to one platform.

</p>

<p>

States unlike stocks you can invest in multiple companies, what is stopping you from investing in multiple platforms as I do?

</p>

<h2>How can we debunk them</h2>

<p>

Taxes, while this is different in Australia and is less of a problem as our tax system does not discriminate based on income type like is such in America he still makes a good point.

</p>

<p>

Lending Club does have a bad reputation, yes, However this brings me right back to point 6.

</p>
<blockquote>

<p>

It is important to note as always, while all the information is provided in faith that it is accurate and reliable. It is to be noted I am not a financal adviser

<p><cite>― Jean Paul Sartre</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>

Again, an investment not being liquid does not mean it is a bad investment.

</p>

<p>

States the business has it better than consumer with fees, yes they do. They put in the work starting the business, same reason any business owner makes more than an employee.

</p>

<p>

Again, defaults and fees should be calculated BEFORE investing.

</p>

<p>

States unlike stocks you can invest in multiple companies, what is stopping you from investing in multiple platforms as I do?

</p>

<p>You forget you’re looking at a hospital website when you read their heartwarming headline.</p>
