<p>It’s terrifying research. 
<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/life-sciences-and-health-care/articles/great-consolidation-health-systems.html">50% of the current hospital systems will not exist in the next 10 years.</a> Meaning, mediocre hospitals will drop like flies in a few years.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<p>You see, that’s not surprising in the slightest.</p>
  
<p>When the number of choices patients face keep growing; when your staff takes refuge in functional silos instead of a collaborative ecosystem; when you face the jagged transition to value-based care; when the market dynamics changes before you adapt; when patient retention dwindles down;or when your hospital is swimming in a sameness-sea of “me too” hospitals, it’s no surprise half of the current health systems will vanish.</p>

<p>So, how will you cut through these hurdles?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: Implement a hospital branding strategy.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that? </p>

Graham certainly did some research but <strong>clearly not enough</strong>.
</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>

Nate O' Brian by far has the most fair and realistic review of P2P (Second to me of course!).

If you look in his comment section you will actually see my behemoth of a comment.

<p>

Fees should be taken into account and most platforms show returns AFTER fees but Graham paints this as a horrible factor.

States that when someone defaults it is bad that only 12-13% of people pay back debt when collected by a third party.

</p>

<p>This is good research, however, <a href="#">defaults should be he states</a>.</p>
<p>

Next he goes onto to state 7.8% default (fail to pay back the loan).
</p>

<p>Yes, across all quality loans...</p>

<div class="takeaway">
<h4># KEY TAKEAWAY</h4>
<p>When analyzing the top-ranking pages, make an effort to assess the overall quality and depth of the content as opposed to looking for traditional indicators of poor optimization (e.g., keyword in the title, etc.). Your job is then to create a better page than those that already rank, not a “better optimized” one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, don’t try to measure the relevance of page with any kind of “score”—whatever methodology or technology you’re using for that, Google almost certainly isn’t using it.
</p>
</div>

<p>

Liquidity, yes, he is right the loan  P2P as a whole a "BAD" investment instrument.

</p>

<p>

I will be careful with this one Graham does use the words "most" and "potentially" so he is being honest of course, I just think he does not have a full understanding of how this all works

</p>

<p>

<b>BIGGEST ISSUE</b>, it seems his judgement of P2P Lending as a whole like many reviews (which we will get to soon), is based on only one platform, in this case Lending Club.

</p>

<p>

Default rates will go up during a recession, yes, however large.

<h2>What are these problems</h2>

<p>

Taxes, while this is different in Australia and is less of a problem as our tax system does not discriminate based on income type like is such in America he still makes a good point.

</p>

<p>

Lending Club does have a bad reputation, yes, However this brings me right back to point 6.

<p>

Again, an investment not being liquid does not mean it is a bad investment.

</p>

<p>

States the business has it better than consumer with fees, yes they do. They put in the work starting the business, same reason any business owner makes more than an employee.

</p>

<p>

Again, defaults and fees should be calculated BEFORE investing.

</p>

<p>

States unlike stocks you can invest in multiple companies, what is stopping you from investing in multiple platforms as I do?

Yes, fraud possibly occurred but this also happened 1000x over in companies throughout history all over the world. This is again referring to one platform.
