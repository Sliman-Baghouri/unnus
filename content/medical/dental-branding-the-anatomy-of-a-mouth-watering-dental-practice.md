{{% hook %}} **You want your patients to fall head-over-heels in love with your practice?**{{% /hook %}}

{{% hook %}} **The answer is straightforward: build a charismatic dental brand.**{{% /hook %}}

***

In an age where your would-be patients are bombarded with **pushy** ads and cringe marketing, it’s a privilege to see a **pulling force**.

Pulling force that _we_ gravitate towards. Not pushed into.

That’s what charismatic brands do, they pull. Like magnets.

Today, I’ll share with you what is **dental branding**, and how by branding your practice you can achieve these charismatic attributes.

I’ll share also the 3 deadly sins dental practices make when trying to build an authentic brand.

This article covers:

* What is dental branding? What it is not, and other myths.
* What makes up a drab, bland, and dull dental brand.
* What makes up a charismatic dental brand.
* Advantages of having a charismatic dental brand.
* Quick techniques to know if your practice _is_ charismatic
* And more…

## Common misconceptions about dental branding 

First, Let’s discuss what we mean by a “brand”.

To do that, let’s wipe the slate clean and explaining what _is_ not a brand:

* It is not your practice logo or a name. The logo is a symbol or emblem that carries a visual representation of the business.
* It is not a visual aspect of your business or its design identity.
* A brand is not a product, when people say “I bought brand X” they mean “they bought product X”
* A brand is not a “sum of all impression”
* It is not a “promise”.

I’ve seen this definition float around from [AMA](https://www.ama.org/topics/branding/ "Wrong branding definition ")

_“Branding. A brand is a name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.”_

Again, That’s NOT what a brand is.

The above definition is a more literal meaning.

## So, what is dental branding?

Simply: **A brand is a customer’s GUT FEELING about your organization and your care service.**

It’s a gut feeling because brands are defined by individuals –not companies or markets.

A brand is a gut feeling because people are emotional, instinctive beings.

And your patients base their buying decisions on trust or confidence they get from your communication channels.

{{% blockquote "Marty Neumeier, The brand gap" %}} A brand is not what you say it is, it's what they say it is. {{% /blockquote %}}

Branding, on the other hand, is the management of all elements that make your dental practice charismatic.

What are these elements? I’ll get to this point in a minute.

_(if you’re in a hurry, navigate to these elements from the table of content on your right)_

## Pitfalls that makes your dental brand bland

We’ll explore the usual suspects that might be hurting your practice.

If you feel like you’ve been caught with your hand in the cookie jar, worry not.

I’ll reference solutions in the next section.

Without further ado, let’s start.

### I) Not Standing for a philosophy.

{{% blockquote "David Hagenbuch" %}} many consumers, such as millennials and gen-Yers, are eager to support organizations that look beyond their bottom lines to the needs of others. When they can, purpose-driven people will vote with their dollars for purpose-driven businesses {{% /blockquote %}}

Which begs the question, why?

Why do people seem to vouch for purpose-driven business?

The reason for that is embedded in our core.

We, humans, value meaningful relationships.

A meaningful business that has a sense of direction will make life more bearable.

Why would a dentist choose to work at a rigid, spreadsheet-driven organization over one that possesses a high sense of mission?

{{% important %}} No one wants to be treated in a dental facility where the most “meaningful substance” they could ever conjure up is a display of their googled mission statement.

To be purpose-driven means to act out your beliefs.

And not to put them as a decoration for an “about us” section.  
 {{% /important%}}

### II) The trap of “me too” purposes.

Have you ever skimmed through an about section of your competitors and seen the same damn thing repeated multiple times?

* We believe in a passionate care
* We believe in providing the best oral care
* Best dental equipment for patients
* Accountability, Better Smile, Responsibility

This is the trap most dental practices fall into when they try to be purpose-driven

The first thing they do is to look up a mission or a purpose statement.

Pick 4 values from the 12 virtue list.

Post it on their website and they call it a day.

  
**_This is the fast lane to dissolve in the “lookalike dental brands” limbo_**

While these values are noble, from a business standpoint, they are problematic.

**The issue is twofold:**

1. They are overused and will make your practice look ingenuine or “trying to relate”
2. They are broadly defined. And when your objectives are broadly defined like “to provide quality care” you run the risk of not having systematic steps to hit your goals

### III) Not different enough.

Being unique in your care offerings doesn’t require you to pose a service line that no one has.

You could offer the same services to everyone and still be different.

How?

_By being different **from** your competitors **in the eyes** of your potential patients_

That’s what we call **positioning**.

{{% note "CASE STUDY" %}} 

Confidental™, a client of ours that provides cosmetic dentistry to its patients in napa valley, CA.

We positioned the practice as the only dental practice that empowers its patients with confidence through dental appearance.

You see, they offer the same care services but it has a unique difference in the market.

Patients go to Confidental™ not because of oral care, but because they are empowered by how good their dental appearance is.

They went there to get confident.

### IV) They are not strategic in communicating with patients.

This is not to say you need to rehearse talks or engineer conversions.

What you need to do is to be selective in the communication with the patients/would-be patients.
