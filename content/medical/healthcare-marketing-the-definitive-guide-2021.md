Healthcare marketing is the discipline of implementing promotional strategies to engage and attract a steady stream of patient flow to your medical facility. The main goal of marketing in the healthcare industry is to generate patients while building a strong brand name for your medical business.

## Top healthcare marketing strategies

An easy mistake to make is going straight into marketing without building the foundation for it, your **brand**.

A common misconception is that by building **brand awareness** (being known by many) you can form a “brand”. However, being “well-known” is partial to what makes up a brand. You can be popular, but brandless-ly so.

Building your [healthcare brand](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/) is about being razor-sharp clear on what your brand does **differently** and how it can create an unforgettable patient experience. It’s about building the architecture from which the marketing can start to thrive.

Think of your branding as the DNA of your medical practice. It’s the glue that holds the business together and provides your patients with reasons on why they should choose you over the others.

Not only that, but branding can increase your brand preference (BP). Which is a cognitive judgment a patient makes regarding your brand.

It measures to which extent purchasing decisions are made based on the attachment and loyalty to your brand rather than the price, convenience, or regardless of the alternatives.
