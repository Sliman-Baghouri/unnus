{{% hook %}}Today, I'll share with you battle-tested tips that’ll help you reignite your practice’s growth and catapult it out of the plateau phase. {{% /hook %}}

Let’s face it, running your medical clinic is hard as it is, let alone growing it. Scaling up your practice requires a different approach and each one is taking your attention. Do you focus on the clinical or the business side? How much time and money should you allocate to grow your medical business? What tactics to prioritize and what strategies to skip past?

  
Without wasting too much time, let’s dive right ahead.

## 1) Streamline your appointments and reduce unnecessary administrative tasks.

Growing your clinic isn’t a matter of increasing patient volume alone. One of the best tips to [grow your practice ](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-marketing/)is to enhance its internal processes and remove unnecessary workloads. And a great way to do this is to increase the ease of use and convenience in your clinic.

According to a recent study, [51% ](https://nrchealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2019-Healthcare-Consumer-Trends-Report.pdf)of all patients say that convenient and easy to access care is the most important factor in their decision-making. A staggering 80% of patients say that they select providers based on convenience factor alone. This is no surprise. People are busier than ever and the last thing they want is to get stifled by inefficient scheduling processes.

Facilitating the appointments for your patients will lower the “friction” of having to visit you. This will lead to speedier scheduling, fewer complaints, efficient processes, and more retained patients. And a great way to streamline your appointment is to use online medical scheduling software.

Online scheduling offers unmatched advantages when it comes to increasing patient convenience. It saves you the time of having to follow up with people for additional appointments and reduces the burden of the administrative tasks for your staff.

Plus, because such software works 24/7, it allows patients to make appointments outside business hours. Not only that, but it offers your patient complete freedom of their possible slots. They can change or cancel their booking at their own accord and without having to pick up the phone each time.

If your clinic is not using online booking appointments, it’s time to integrate such a tool within your medical business. It will gain your practice a competitive advantage and increase patient preference towards your brand.

## 2) Use Patient Journey Mapping to enhance the patient experience.

Another great way to enhance the internal processes of your medical clinic is to implement [Patient Journey Maps](https://unnus.com/medical/patient-journey-mapping/) (PJM). A Patient Journey Map (also known as a customer journey map) is a visual map that outlines a series of events the patient goes through from her/his first interaction with your clinic until after-treatment.

Each contact point your patients have with your clinic is considered part of their journey. The goal of this strategy is to optimize, track and enhance these touchpoints to overhaul the patient experience.

PJMs allows you to “reverse engineer” the whole patient experience and uncover hidden issues that are hindering your clinic’s growth. By doubling down on each step of the patient journey, you’ll have a zoomed-in picture of what’s happening during each event. This simple yet potent strategy is the cause of [54% greater ROI](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/02/22/the-eyepopping-roi-of-customer-journey-mapping.html) and exceptional growth for thousands of businesses year after year.

But one advantage this strategy offers that can’t be found elsewhere is the ability to personalize each step of the experience the way _you_ want it.

Because the PJM focuses on optimizing each part of the patient journey, you can easily sketch the perfect patient experience and tailor it to your ideal patient. This is a huge opportunity for you to increase your patient retention rate and increase their engagement.

## 3) Integrate an Email Marketing Funnel

Based on recent research by the DMA organization, email marketing scores an ROI of $41 for every $1 spent. That’s roughly 4000% return on investment. Which makes it a strong marketing channel to acquire new patients regularly. And one of the best email marketing strategies is **sales funnels**.

A sales funnel is a marketing model that tracks each step of the patient's journey up until they purchase your services. This model aims to engage, provide value, and incentivize potential patients to buy from you. But unlike patient journey maps, the sales funnel tracks, would-be patients, before they decide to purchase your services.

It’s divided into 4 main stages:

* **Awareness Stage**
  * When a would-be patient first knows about your clinic
* **Interest Stage**
  * When potential patients are interested in your content (e,g: emails, blog articles, or videos)
* **Evaluation Stage**
  * When would-be patients are evaluating their choices
* **Purchase Stage**
  * When prospects become patients after booking an appointment with you.

Now we understand sales funnels, let’s see how it is utilized to drive patients to your clinic.

### Using an email sales funnel to generate steady patient flow

This strategy aims to use email automation to send pre-made sequences of emails to your subscribers. These emails are packed with health-related content that helps your subscriber overcome certain health issues. The goal here is manifold:

* To establish credibility and trust between you and the email subscriber
* To provide huge value to your subscribers so they will be more inclined to choose your clinic in the future
* To engage with your subscribers and start building relationships and;
* To upsell your subscribers on your bigger offer (one-on-one care appointment)

Each email in this automated email sequence will provide value to your would-be patient. At the end of this sequence, they will receive an offer from you to book an appointment. At this point, you’ve helped them with their health issues through your content and now they’ll be more receptive to purchase your services.

The following illustration is an example of how email subscribers convert to loyal-patient:

The great thing about this strategy is it’s an automated process. It works 24/7 and generates patients for your clinic on autopilot.

  
**4) Building a Strong Brand Name for your clinic**

With the skyrocketing increase of care services and the surge of DIY healthcare brands, providers are experiencing an unprecedented competitive environment. This flood of brands has made a big impact when it comes to the patient decision process. Now the patient choice has expanded and people are pickier than ever. This leaves medical business owners fist-fighting for the patient’s attention by cutting prices and brawling for patient volume.

But what if you could side-step all of this? What if you could render the competition irrelevant and break through the noise?

This is exactly what brand building is all about.

Building a strong medical brand is about providing patients with razor-sharp clarity on why they should choose your brand over the others. It’s about finding a unique aspect of running your clinic and highlighting that as your [differentiator](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/). A differentiator that no other brand can claim and it’s valuable to your patient base.

For example, maybe you prioritize patient safety and invest in extra precautions and cleanliness of your office. You can build your brand about safety and how you’re brand is **the only medical clinic that offers the safest care.** This positioning will resonate with safety-minded people and your brand will turn into a risk-free choice. Or maybe you want to claim the most convenient medical clinic by providing same-day care and a no-appointment policy.

Whatever your unique differentiator is, make sure it’s not overly used and is valuable to your patient. This way you don’t have to compete because you provide value for your patients that others can’t fulfill.
