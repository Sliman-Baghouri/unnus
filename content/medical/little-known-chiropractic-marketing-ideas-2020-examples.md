## **Why Most Chiropractic Marketing Campaigns Fail**

Let’s take a proactive approach and go through common marketing mistakes so you can avoid them.

### **1) Lacking a strategic purpose articulation**

{{% blockquote "Simon Sinek" %}}People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it {{% /blockquote %}}

Gone are the days where medical businesses offer a robotic value offering marketing messages and wait for patients to come in. Today’s patients expect more from your brand. They want purpose-driven communication. A communication that is infused with purpose and noble cause.

And if your brand’s marketing is filled with the same sounding automated messages, it’ll be stored in your patient’s “Meh” part of the brain.

We take sides with brands that have a mission to fulfill, a purpose to serve, and a grounded vision to follow. That’s because we value meaningful ventures and relationships.

If a chiropractic brand is on a mission to enhance the quality of life ( The Joint Chiropractic), why would I go to the “affordable chiropractic office”?

_“**I have a mission, vision, and purpose statement is that it?”**_

These statements are tossed around a lot. Most of which are used as a decoration to an about us page instead of a compass for a practice to follow.

To know if your practice is purpose-driven ask the following questions:

1. What makes my mission statement different?
2. Is my purpose maintained and integrated into my business?
3. Is my vision strategic and practical? Or is it just wishy-washy claims?
4. Am I **strategically vocal** about my business values?
5. How integrated are my values in my business processes?
6. When patients go out of the door, will they know what our brand stands for?

If you don’t have answers to all of these questions, I’ll share with you the solution in the next section where we discuss how to develop your **brand DNA**.

### **2) Is your chiropractic marketing adding to the clutter?**

With the flooding wellspring of brands, businesses are popping up by the second, fist-fighting for your would-be patient’s attention.

Your competition does not come from other offices, indeed, but from the clutter.

![Healthcare Marketing Clutter](/assets/images/clear-the-clutter.png "Market Clutter")

The average person encounters between[ 6,000 to 10,000 ads](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/08/25/finding-brand-success-in-the-digital-world/?sh=5c62d645626e) daily. **All from the same sounding brands, providing the same sounding offers with the same sounding voice**.

And our brains deal with this clutter the best way it knows how—by blocking most of it out.

We created an unbreachable wall against the never-ending marketing messages by filtering out what’s uninspiring, lookalike, or straight out drab. These walls act as mental **boxes** in our heads to store ONLY the interesting, different, and vibrant.

According to [research ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12115-010-9408-1 "link to the research")conducted by Read Montague, Professor of Neuroscience, strong brands have the power to own a “box” or a piece of our frontal cortex.

Being radically different is the only way to cut through this clutter. It is your ticket to secure a seat in your patient’s mental boxes of “brands to remember”.

So, before marketing, ask yourself, does our marketing messages look the same as everyone else’s? Are we adding to the clutter?

### **3) Embarking on a vision-blind marketing campaign**

Marketing a practice for the sake of increasing patient volume or growing profit margins is insufficient. These are the poor man's success metrics.

You need a business vision that goes beyond the “time-bounded” growth indicators. Most chiropractic marketing campaigns over-invest in short-term gains (quarterly revenues, ROI, volume) while incurring a long-term loss of their identity (patient loyalty, brand equity, brand preference).

The vision you put in place must account for future stability for your practice and decreased marketing costs. To do that you also need to change your success measurability.

We shouldn’t be slaves to the growth curves. Instead of focusing on the short-term indicators, we must reroute our attention to more meaningful ones.

### **4) Misalignment between the marketing and the patient experience**

![consistent chiropractic marketing vs out of sync chiropractic marketing](/assets/images/consistant-chiropractic-marketing.jpg "consistent chiropractic marketing vs out of sync chiropractic marketing")

A common trap Marketers fall into, is that the marketing is not in sync with the patient experience. Marketers get caught in increasing the patient volume and outright disregard the consistency of the campaign.

Consistency is critical. From the first encounter, your patient has with you until they get out of your office, everything needs to vibrate at the same frequency.

If you skew from what you promised in the marketing, your brand gets diluted and patients feel the inauthenticity. A poorly thought campaign that does not take your business’s philosophy into account will be prone to create mixed signals.

## **Chiropractic Marketing strategies**

Let’s check some interesting marketing strategies.

## **1) Developing a Brand DNA**

![illustration of brand DNA in healthcare](/assets/images/brand-dna.PNG "illustration of brand DNA in healthcare")

Brand DNA is the credo of your chiropractic brand. It is the true north that directs your practice. Brand DNA consists of three elements: your **why**, **how, and what**. The “What and how” is what you do and how you do it. And the “Why” is the reason for the practice to exist.

Sounds simple? Not really.

In his book, Start With The Way, Author Simon Sinek suggests that most businesses know **what** they do, and **how** they do it, but few know **why** they do what they do.

Why do you do what you do besides making a profit? Why would anyone care? And are you vocal about it? These seemingly easy but surprisingly hard to answer questions are the difference between ridiculously loved brands and average commodities.

Businesses who can articulate their **Why** to their audience enjoy cult-like following, automatic repurchases, and soaring patient retention rate.

That’s because when you communicate with purpose-backed messages, your marketing is perceived by the limbic system, the part of the brain that is responsible for emotions, and [decision-making](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032808/).

Purpose-backed messages are marketing messages that are infused with a high sense of mission, jargon-free, and illustrate your business’s purpose. We also call them **Why Messages**.

Communicating with **Why Messages** differentiates you from the rest.

To help you see the difference, let’s take two different pitches, one is a **Why** message, and the other is a basic value offer pitch (A What Message).

**#\~First, What Message (basic value offer)**

_We’re Athletim, we provide personalized natural care through our comprehensive health and wellness plan. We help patients unleash their potential and live a pain-free lifestyle._

It states who they are, and what they do. Great. It also explains how this benefits patients. Let’s see how the pitch will look like when your “why” is well articulated.

**#\~Second, Why Message (purpose-infused communication)**

_What good is a lifestyle if it's restricted, stifled by discomfort, and not lived fully? Our practice was founded to free people from these layers of limitation. We believe everyone has the aptitude to accomplish greatness if they can harness their potential. We’re Athletim, we peel off physical restriction, pain hindrance, and help you lead an anxiety-free lifestyle._

The second pitch doesn't sell you what they do. They’re selling you **why** they’re doing it. This tightens the relationship and loyalty for the business and transforms its perceived value (a.k.a brand equity).

![healthcare purposeful messages and how they are perceived](/assets/images/why-messaging-and-limbic-system.png "healthcare purposeful messages and how they are perceived")

If you’d like to know how you develop a DNA and integrate it into your marketing communication, Here's a [free guide ](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-mission-statement/#brand-dna-creating-a-mission-and-a-purpose-statement)to implement it within your business.

## **2) Developing a Brand Positioning Strategy**

A positioning strategy aims to develop a key element that differentiates your chiropractic brand. And your positioning is where your business stands **in relation to** other brands.

To illustrate, I’ll use an example from a Netflix series called Better call Saul.

In one of the episodes, the protagonist, James Mcgill, had to work in a mobile store where there are no customers whatsoever.

The branch James worked in sells the same phones as every competitor. There was nothing that merits his store.

Fed up with this, one day, James painted on the store’s frontend the following statement:

**_“Is The Man Listening? Privacy Sold Here”_**

![positioning example in healthcare](/assets/images/positioning-in-healthcare.jpg "positioning example in healthcare")  
While you can buy the same phone somewhere else, James sells **privacy**. He differentiated the store to be **the only store that sells privacy to its customer**.

He knows that his surrounding area is full of drug dealers and smugglers. So The statement “Privacy sold here” resonates with people that want to keep a low profile.

Although this is a fictional story, the concept it presents holds true to real-life marketing.

But before we dive into the “how”, I want to drive home a concept many might find counterintuitive. And that is **focusing your business**.

### **#\~To focus or to defocus: is your practice focused enough?**

{{% blockquote "Marty Neumeier" %}}An unfocused brand is one that’s so broad that it doesn’t stand for anything. A focused brand, by contrast, knows exactly what it is, why it’s different, and why people want it.{{% /blockquote %}}

![focused chiropractic brand vs defocused chiropractic brand](/assets/images/brand-focus.jpg "focused chiropractic brand vs defocused chiropractic brand")  
In his book, The Win Without Pitching Manifesto, author Blair Enns calls positioning “The Difficult Business Decision”.

And it makes sense.

Many when asked to focus their brand to serve specific kinds of people with specific kinds of offers, think it limits their outreach.

An example of focusing is being a practice that focuses on pediatrics. It might sound restricting at first, After all, If we narrow our offering, won’t we narrow our opportunities for profit? Answer: Not necessarily.

History has shown that it pays handsomely to be number one in your category—first, because of higher margins, and second because the risk of commoditization is almost nonexistent.

The exact opposite of this is what we call brand dilution: when you try to be everything to everybody and windup like every other practice. By being broad, you defocus your brand and leave it up to would-be patients to decide where to go.

If there are multiple chiropractic offices, offering the same services, for the same patients, why should they choose you? Better equipment? Can be bought or as easily acquired. Better quality care? Everybody claims so. Affordable? Well, you run the risk of participating in a race to the bottom.

**Focusing** your brand could be also about how you deliver your care and not the people you serve. Maybe you’re the most convenient chiropractor. Or your practice is focused on same-day care and being the fastest service in your domain for busy people.

Focusing the brand to serve specific people with specific needs is what sets you apart and gives it clarity. It is a declaration of authority and expertise.

Now, with that out of the way, let’s position and try to focus our earlier example, **Athletim™**.

### **#\~The process to conduct a positioning strategy for your practice**

The positioning strategy consists of 3 stages:

1. Audience Persona
2. Differentiator Development
3. Onliness Statement Development

Let’s tackle them one by one.

**1) Audience Persona**

In this stage, we stress your ideal patients and their characteristics. Knowing your target audience lets you connect and align yourself with their needs more deeply.

To get a firm understanding of your target audience we’ll use Audience Persona Exercises™.

![Audience Persona Exercise  ](/assets/images/target-audience.jpg "Audience Persona Exercise")

You can download PDF or print this exercise [for free here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wf-g82pWAIhgsWup8KUZxoOhJ6qaWh6E/view?usp=sharing).

The team over Athletim™ chiropractic has years of experience working with athletes and athletic injuries, so they decided to focus on athletes and gymnasts.

Now we have a rough idea of who we’d like to serve, let’s plot their wants and needs in the Audience Persona Diagram.

Ask yourself and your team the following:

1. **For goals**: What objectives they have as it relates to your offering?
2. **For problems: What are the problems your patient faces before they know you?**
3. **For Impact: What do they fear because of those problems?**
4. **For Desires: What’d be the desirable experience? What would be the best-case scenario after they get your treatment?**

Write down the answers in sticky notes and place them in their respective quadrant. If you’d like to perform this workshop online, you can use [Miro](https://miro.com/) with your team, it’s easy and free.

Once you’ve done that, circle the important findings to describe your target audience in 1 or 2 short sentences.

For Athletim™ the result will look something like this:

![Audience Persona Exercise](/assets/images/target-audience-filled.jpg "Audience Persona Exercise")

**2) Differentiator Development**

After knowing your audience, it’s time to develop a differentiator. And for that, we’ll use Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise™ (BDG).

The BDG helps you achieve the following:

1. Plot potential unique value offers or differentiator, And;
2. Evaluate your possible differentiators based on how important they are to your patients and;
3. To check whether or not the competition is using the same differentiators.

![Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise](/assets/images/brand-differentiator-graph.jpg "Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise")

You can access this template [for free here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMtUN9NPPtx2Bj-km5M-26VM6lNHKkf8/view?usp=sharing).

Furthermore, the graph is split into four sections:

1. **Unappreciated efforts**: This section holds everything that most of your competitors have and is of little importance to your patient. Having an about us website is of no practical use to your patient. And every competitor mostly has one. So it's an unappreciated effort if you have one.
2. **Fulfilled priorities**: This section holds critical parts of your chiropractic business such as a good office space. It is important for your patients but it doesn’t set you apart per se.
3. **Secondary differentiators**: Here are aspects of your business that are different and most competitors don’t have but they don’t add value for your patients. For example, an online booking system.
4. **Primary differentiators**: These are differentiators that are key to your success. Because they add high value to your patients and your competitors do not have this unique aspect. For example, if you’re an expert at pediatric injuries and most of your competitors don’t have the experience you have.

On the x-axis is how important the differentiator is to your patients. On the y axis is how prevalent this differentiator is in the competitive landscape.

Brainstorm possible differentiators and writing down on sticky notes possible unique aspects about your practice or a different approach to your service.

If you don’t have a unique aspect, in particular, try to think of how you can outmaneuver everyone and take another approach to your practice.

A few questions to give you a head start:

1. What does our practice do differently and exceptionally well?
2. What are the unmet needs that patients are experiencing in the chiropractic field?
3. What do our competitors do mediocrely?
4. What are some of the chiropractic industry “standards” that we can diverge from?
5. What sort of luxury patients are not aware of, that could elevate their experience?

Write all of the possible ideas and start plotting them on the BDG.

Athletim™’s graph will look something like this:

  
![Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise](/assets/images/differentiator-graph.jpg "Brand Differentiator Graph Exercise")

  
**3) Onliness Statement Development**

Onliness Statement is a positioning statement that radically differentiates your practice and gives it a razor-sharp clarity. It’s simple yet the hardest part of the positioning strategy.

The onliness statement declares the only thing that your practice does uniquely and no other competitor can claim.

We’re going to use Onliness Statement Exercise™ and sticky notes to finish this strategy.

![Onliness Statement Exercise Healthcare](/assets/images/onliness-statement.jpg "Onliness Statement Exercise Healthcare")

You can access this [free exercise here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHvdXLWaJreI0xWlAoZjvAor1GZiJSj_/view?usp=sharing).

The template of the statement is as follows:

Our \[Offering/Brand\] Is the only \[Category\] That \[Differentiator\].

And here are examples from our clients to take inspiration from:

**Odentia, Pasadena-based dental practice slashes the dental horror show that patients are afraid of with their onliness statement.**

![](/assets/images/statement-3.jpg)  
**In the age of malpractice, Healthier, an Orlando-based hospital, took a stance by positioning their hospital as the risk-free care center.**

![Healthcare Positioning statement ](/assets/images/positioning-1.jpg "Healthcare Positioning statement ")  
Let’s see how this will turn out with our chiropractic example, Athletim™.

First, take inspiration from the **Brand Differentiator Graph™**, to finish the onliness statement. It is better to take primary differentiators from the graph because they are already unique to your business.

On the right side of the Onliness Statement Exercise template, there are four quadrants where you can stick candidates’ statements. After you and your team gather a few ideas, vote on which one is the most suitable for your practice.

**Athletim’s Onliness Statement:**

![chiropractic unique selling proposition ](/assets/images/chiropractic-positioning-statement.jpg "chiropractic unique selling proposition ")

## 3) Optical Communication Strategy

In an age of time-poor and information-rich patients, aesthetics are the language of the future. Despite our bias towards imagery, visuals are the most underutilized aspect of marketing in the chiropractic field.

Rifle through any chiropractic brand and you’ll notice the pattern of the predictable logos, lookalike colors, and the endless icons of spine symbols.

Everything looks the same you wonder why people bothered designing a logo to create distinction.

Visuals should convey meaning, message, and your positioning in the market. They should never be a derivative of “what’s already out there”.

The Optical Communication Strategy (OCS) aims to slice through the “me too” aesthetics and present your differentiators using art direction.

This strategy will overhaul your visual identity (Logo, Web Design, Referral pads, Office Design, signage, etc..). It also creates a consistent identity that **mirrors** your brand’s positioning and philosophies.

So, how can you portray these attributes visually to potential patients?

**Optical Communication Strategy: The step-by-step process**

I’ll use one of our clients as an example of this process. The following guide is one that we applied here at unnus with Confidental, a dental practice based in Napa Valley. But the same can be applied to your chiropractic practice.

Confidental™ noticed that their competitors are squeezing the air out of the “have-a-better-smile” statements.

So, to differentiate their brand, they put a brand strategy in place.

During the branding workshop, we spot an insightful observation:

Most of the patients didn’t book a visit to get “premium oral care”. They went to the dentist because they wanted to eradicate self-consciousness.

Sure, a crooked or chipped tooth is a “reason” for why they went there. However, getting rid of that issue is a means to an end—to be more confident in their dental appearance.

Knowing this, we positioned Confidental™ as **the only dental practice that prioritizes its patient’s confidence**.

The Confidental™ brand stands for:

* Confidence and certitude
* Fostering self-regard for its patients
* Assurance and reliance

Now to convey their philosophy and communicate their positioning visually, we conducted an optical communication strategy.

The OCS consist of 3 stages:

1. Brand Keyword Disbandment (BKD)
2. Visualization
3. Creative Process

**1) Brand Keyword Disbandment (BKD)**

In this stage, you gather up all the keywords that are related to your brand and categorize them as seen below.

In the case of Confidental™ Brand keywords will look like this:
