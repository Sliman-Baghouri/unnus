## **Why Most Chiropractic Marketing Campaigns Fail**

Let’s take a proactive approach and go through common marketing mistakes so you can avoid them.

### **1) Lacking a strategic purpose articulation**

Gone are the days where medical businesses offer a robotic value offering marketing messages and wait for patients to come in. Today’s patients expect more from your brand. They want purpose-driven communication. A communication that is infused with purpose and noble cause.

And if your brand’s marketing is filled with the same sounding automated messages, it’ll be stored in your patient’s “Meh” part of the brain.

We take sides with brands that have a mission to fulfill, a purpose to serve, and a grounded vision to follow. That’s because we value meaningful ventures and relationships.

If a chiropractic brand is on a mission to enhance the quality of life ( The Joint Chiropractic), why would I go to the “affordable chiropractic office”?

_“**I have a mission, vision, and purpose statement is that it?”**_

These statements are tossed around a lot. Most of which are used as a decoration to an about us page instead of a compass for a practice to follow.

To know if your practice is purpose-driven ask the following questions:

1. What makes my mission statement different?
2. Is my purpose maintained and integrated into my business?
3. Is my vision strategic and practical? Or is it just wishy-washy claims?
4. Am I **strategically vocal** about my business values?
5. How integrated are my values in my business processes?
6. When patients go out of the door, will they know what our brand stands for?

If you don’t have answers to all of these questions, I’ll share with you the solution in the next section where we discuss how to develop your **brand DNA**.

### **2) Is your chiropractic marketing adding to the clutter?**

With the flooding wellspring of brands, businesses are popping up by the second, fist-fighting for your would-be patient’s attention.

Your competition does not come from other offices, indeed, but from the clutter.

The average person encounters between[ 6,000 to 10,000 ads](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/08/25/finding-brand-success-in-the-digital-world/?sh=5c62d645626e) daily. **All from the same sounding brands, providing the same sounding offers with the same sounding voice**.

And our brains deal with this clutter the best way it knows how—by blocking most of it out.

We created an unbreachable wall against the never-ending marketing messages by filtering out what’s uninspiring, lookalike, or straight out drab. These walls act as mental **boxes** in our heads to store ONLY the interesting, different, and vibrant.

According to [research ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12115-010-9408-1 "link to the research")conducted by Read Montague, Professor of Neuroscience, strong brands have the power to own a “box” or a piece of our frontal cortex.

Being radically different is the only way to cut through this clutter. It is your ticket to secure a seat in your patient’s mental boxes of “brands to remember”.

So, before marketing, ask yourself, does our marketing messages look the same as everyone else’s? Are we adding to the clutter?
