{{% hook %}}If you’re bored with the same “lookalike” dental sites, we are too. Let’s check some of the most creative dental websites. {{% /hook %}} <!--more-->

***

We’ve curated one of the best dental websites for 2021. These works put the usual dull healthcare websites to shame. You can Navigate using the content table on your right to jump between the designs.

Let’s start with our first site.

## 1) Aesthetics Dental

![](/assets/images/best-dental-websites-1.PNG)

Our first design comes from [Spring Art Studio](https://dribbble.com/shots/16076596-Medical-Dental-Web-App-Website). What I like about this concept is the intersection between the main image and the website elements that gives it this “overlapping” effect. And while the contrast between the white text and the background needs a little bit more work, it makes for an intriguing dental website.

## 2) Aesthetics Dental Laboratory

Again, our friends at Spring art studio made a second concept for an aesthetics dental lab. What makes this one unique lies in its use of the modern design of 3D Model. This interactive model makes browsing the website more enjoyable to the user.

## 3) D-Care landing page

Our next design is done by the Australian based agency [Studio Express](https://dribbble.com/shots/14650049/). The well-thought out website structure from its headline, Call To Action button and patient reviews makes it perfect for the user to use. In addition, the minimalist approach and the use of white spaces made the website radiate a modern feel.

## 4) San Francisco Dental

The next design is from the talented UX/UI designer [Songeez](https://dribbble.com/shots/15276194/). What this website gets right is the creative use of imagery. While using white coats and office spaces images can inform the user of the business, San Francisco Dental focuses its imagery more on the patient.

## 5) Dental Care DSO

The Huston texas based creative [Tino Agency](https://dribbble.com/shots/9173229-Dental-care-Web-design) has decided to switch it off a little bit by using costume illustration to their dental website concept. The well placed email form and the minimalist aspect of the home page makes it easy for the visitors to take action and sign up immediately upon their landing.

## 6) 24 Dentist

[Merix Studio ](https://dribbble.com/shots/10809125-Dental-Care-layout-concept)is known for their simplicity when it comes to web design. And this dazzling dashboard is their way of showing why simple design works. Instead of bombarding the user with unending pop ups and texts, Merix decided to declutter the website and give enough room for all the elements to breathe. This makes the website a breeze to use and highly effective.

## 7) Smile Wow Dental

Our next website comes from the professional UI designer [Naresh](https://dribbble.com/shots/11227626-WowSmile-Homepage-Design-V2/) and his concept of Smile Wow dental website. What stands out in this layout is the perfect use of visual hierarchy and the well placed call to action buttons. This kind of conversion-focused design makes smile wow’s website perfect for attracting more patients online.

## 8) Dentora Dental Care

The next website is designed by the Bangladesh based web designer [Dibbendo Pranto](https://dribbble.com/shots/6417654-Dental-Medical-Website) and his concept of Dentora Dental. Dibbendo nailed the design in a variety of ways, from the hovering video section, the divided header and the modern feel of the website.

## 9) Channel Dental Platform

What happens when a creative powerhouse collaborates with the smartest dentist in Washington? Well, the Channel :D platform. The dental engagement platform has differentiated itself from the “lookalike” by adopting a unique black & white style to their website. Along with the bespoke illustration, [Shakuro ](https://dribbble.com/shots/14842406/)agency has made a masterpiece.

## 10) Profimed Dental Store

![](/assets/images/best-dental-websites-10.PNG)

The [SMDK Design agency](https://dribbble.com/shots/11008054-Profimed-Design-Concept) Turned Profimed dental store into a premium brand by adapting a minimalist design to reflect modern feel and look for the company. And while the website is beautifully made, what makes this one different is its accessibility and how easy it is to use for dental product shoppers.

## 11) Machniak Orthodontics Clinic

The Polish Dental Clinic Machniak redesigned their website to match the current aesthetic standards of the competitive landscape. What differentiates the website is the flawless aggregation of content and the seamless scrolling experience. This trendy piece of work was designed by [Daniel Jędrzejczyk](https://dribbble.com/shots/8248701/).

## 12) VC Dentistry Clinic

Our next website is designed by the indian based UX designer [Abir Mahmood](https://dribbble.com/shots/6455215/attachments/6455215-Dental-Landing-Page-Design). What I like the most about this piece of art is its unconventional layout. Instead of the boring “bricks-boxes-like” layout, Abir managed to craft an appealing and interesting arrangement of content.
