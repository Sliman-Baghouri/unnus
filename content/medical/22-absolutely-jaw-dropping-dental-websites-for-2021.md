{{% hook %}}If you’re bored with the same “lookalike” dental sites, we are too. Let’s check some of the most creative dental websites. {{% /hook %}} <!--more-->

***

We’ve curated one of the best dental websites for 2021. These works put the usual dull healthcare websites to shame. You can Navigate using the content table on your right to jump between the designs.

Let’s start with our first site.

## 1) Aesthetics Dental

Our first design comes from [Spring Art Studio](https://dribbble.com/shots/16076596-Medical-Dental-Web-App-Website). What I like about this concept is the intersection between the main image and the website elements that gives it this “overlapping” effect. And while the contrast between the white text and the background needs a little bit more work, it makes for an intriguing dental website.

## 2) Aesthetics Dental Laboratory

Again, our friends at Spring art studio made a second concept for an aesthetics dental lab. What makes this one unique lies in its use of the modern design of 3D Model. This interactive model makes browsing the website more enjoyable to the user.
