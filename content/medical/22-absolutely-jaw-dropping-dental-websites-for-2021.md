{{% hook %}}If you’re bored with the same “lookalike” dental sites, we are too. Let’s check some of the most creative dental websites. {{% /hook %}} <!--more-->

We’ve curated one of the best dental websites for 2021. These works put the usual dull healthcare websites to shame. You can Navigate using the content table on your right to jump between the designs.

Let’s start with our first site.

## 1) Aesthetics Dental

Our first design comes from [Spring Art Studio](https://dribbble.com/shots/16076596-Medical-Dental-Web-App-Website). What I like about this concept is the intersection between the main image and the website elements that gives it this “overlapping” effect. And while the contrast between the white text and the background needs a little bit more work, it makes for an intriguing dental website.

## 2) Aesthetics Dental Laboratory

Again, our friends at Spring art studio made a second concept for an aesthetics dental lab. What makes this one unique lies in its use of the modern design of 3D Model. This interactive model makes browsing the website more enjoyable to the user.

## 3) D-Care landing page

Our next design is done by the Australian based agency [Studio Express](https://dribbble.com/shots/14650049/). The well-thought out website structure from its headline, Call To Action button and patient reviews makes it perfect for the user to use. In addition, the minimalist approach and the use of white spaces made the website radiate a modern feel.

## 4) San Francisco Dental

The next design is from the talented UX/UI designer [Songeez](https://dribbble.com/shots/15276194/). What this website gets right is the creative use of imagery. While using white coats and office spaces images can inform the user of the business, San Francisco Dental focuses its imagery more on the patient.

## 5) Dental Care DSO

The Huston texas based creative [Tino Agency](https://dribbble.com/shots/9173229-Dental-care-Web-design) has decided to switch it off a little bit by using costume illustration to their dental website concept. The well placed email form and the minimalist aspect of the home page makes it easy for the visitors to take action and sign up immediately upon their landing.

## 6) 24 Dentist
