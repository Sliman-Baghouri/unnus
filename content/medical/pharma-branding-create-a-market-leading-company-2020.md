In this article, we’ll discuss fatal but easy-to-turn-a-blind-to issues in the pharmaceutical industry and how branding can solve these problems.

By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of

1. Threats that Big Pharma is facing
2. What is branding in the pharmaceutical industry?
3. The unmatched advantage of branding; And
4. The 5 stages of developing a pharmaceutical brand strategy

Without wasting time, let’s dive in.

## Threats the pharmaceutical industry is facing

The pharma industry is experiencing a profound change in multiple aspects. From increased competition, constant change in regulation, lack of innovation, and the rapid price increase of the R&D to name a few.

Companies back in the 1960s enjoyed great success with blockbuster drugs upon their approval. The drugs gain a price monopoly from the aggressive defense of its patent and as a result, annual sales soared up until the patent expires.

However, with the pressure of the flooding generic drugs, companies need to find other means to sustain their bottom line.

We’ll go into each threat and examine their risk at length. After that, we’ll explore possible solutions.

### I) The increased cost of R&D and decreased annual sales for blockbuster drugs

Despite the increased cost of the R&D in the last decade, the new products approved by the FDA are roughly the same number as they were in the past. Companies more than ever, are spending billions in expenditure with little to no breakthrough findings.

In addition, the process of developing a new medicine is time-consuming. New products take at least 12 years to develop with a cost of more than $1 billion—an equivalent budget for launching a rocket to outer space.

With all these resources being thrown at the R&D, you’d expect a strong correlation between how much is spent and a long-lasting high annual sales. but that’s not the case.

There are mainly 3 factors as to why:

1. **Blockbuster drugs no longer possess the advantage of _sales exclusivity_**: (the remaining period a drug will be protected from competition by its patent).
   1. With the ever-shrinking period of patents, blockbuster’s great impact on annual sales is diminishing.
2. **The stream of generic drugs**.
   1. The competition from generic drugs is fierce. Once a generic equivalent is approved and enters the market, they are sold at a lower price thus, hurting the overall sales of their branded counterparts.
3. **The numbers of failed experimental drugs in the clinical stage are climbing**
   1. In the clinical stage (when testing the drugs on people happens) the sheer amount of failed drugs is now staggeringly high at 93% record according to CRM international. This is not only disappointing but also disheartening to scientists who worked relentlessly on these products.

### II) Decreased in R&D innovation

As the size of your pharmaceutical company grows, the company loses its agility. The processes become more complex, rigid, and inflexible.

To explain why this happens, let’s explore common trap companies fall into when they decide to enhance their performance.

Most firms tend to divide their company into separate divisions to achieve maximum efficiency, however, that only creates functional silos working at cross-purpose.

Therefore giving birth to problems like lack of communication, scientists losing the sense of mission, disconnected decision, and your staff starts sub-optimizing when you need all parts working together.

This rugged business model chips off of your R&D innovation-powerhouse. People get demotivated and their productivity fades away.

It stands to reason that if your stakeholders aren’t circled around a shared purpose, your work productivity will suffer. Costing your company wasted resources and incoherent workflow.

It is your job as the leader to supercharge your organization with a high sense of purpose. Everyone should know the impact of the role he/she plays inside the company. You want your staff to work under one umbrella towards a concrete goal.

### III) The rate at which cutthroat competitions are emerging is getting faster

The barrier to competition is low compared to the past. For example, in 1965, Inderal the first beta-blocker for high blood pressure was launched 1965 and was not followed until 1987 with the launch of Lopressor.

Conversely, Cox-2 anti-rheumatic product Celebrex has launched in 1999 only 3 months ahead of Vioxx.

This increased competition will inevitably force you to cut down prices, leaving your company vulnerable to market commoditization and lower sales.

For companies to enjoy skyrocketing sales and profitability, the need for differentiation, RADICAL differentiation—is dire.

Often radical in business terms means uncertainty. That’s why most firms are reluctant to differentiate or change.

**_However, what if you could differentiate and speed up the rate at which you innovate, simultaneously? This is where branding comes in._**

## What is pharmaceutical branding?

**First**, A brand is not the logo, nor the visuals that make up your product design. A brand is not the product itself, the slogan, or the advertising campaign. A brand is not even controlled by the company behind it.

Rather a brand is a collection of perceptions and feelings that reside in the mind of the customer. While you may not have direct control over your brand, you most certainly are its steward.

Every interaction the customer has with your brand influences their preference-based judgment about it. The product experience, service, slogans, ads, and even product manuals all contribute to the customer perception of your company or product.

Your job is to **cultivate**, **guard**, and **maintain** a strong brand – the rewards of which are consistently loyal customers and a continual increase in sales and preference.

**Second**, you must differentiate. Whether it is a product brand or your corporate brand. It needs to be unique to break out of the market clutter.

This doesn’t mean that the product should be miles away in terms of ingredients or that your organization must reinvent new models.

Differentiation in branding is about **perceptions.** You need to position your company or product in the minds of your audience _differently_ from competitors.

Positioning is the way your audience perceives your product **_in relation to _**other products in the market. If you’d like to see an example of positioning in the pharma industry jump to this section.

**Third**, you need to cultivate your brand. Your brand doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it needs community and stakeholders to thrive. You need to build an ecosystem around it.

We’ll go into the stages of building an authentic brand. But for now, let’s explore the advantages of an established pharma brand.

## Advantages of branding in the pharmaceutical industry

Building a strong brand comes with perks only top pharma companies pose. We’ll go into some of the competitive advantages you gain when you develop an established brand for your company.

### I) An established brand sustain longer drug’s sales exclusivity

Since the patent period is getting shorter, drugs will enjoy less and less annual sales.

For example in the 1980s, a product whose patent expired was able to obtain 60% of its sales turnover one year later. However, in the 1990s that number dropped to 40%, and with Prozac, it dropped even more.

This leaves pharma companies vulnerable to shorter sales exclusivity of their products. However, one way to sustain the drug’s high sales is by leveraging the parent’s company brand.

Leveraging the corporate brand is also a way to gain physician’s trust to prescribe the branded product rather than its generic counterpart.

According to a recent [study by the University of the Sciences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228480652_The_Dual_Role_of_Company_Prescribing_Loyalty_in_New_Drug_Launches) in Philadelphia, physician’s loyalty to a pharmaceutical company affects the prescribing volume of all company’s drugs.

Your corporate brand can also build momentum for the product, trigger sales, and establish differentiation.

We see this in action when Pfizer used its logo on Caduet's pre-launch materials to create a relationship between the company, the therapeutic area, and the product.

### II) Branding creates an unbreachable wall against the competition

With the flood of generic products and the rapid increase of competition in Big Pharma, not standing out is the same as being invisible.

The good news is, branding at its core, is differentiation. And by establishing a [brand strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1vE4S9RQ41K8A6_bkKTqcULZ4Rl4tkgGBBo2jnK6QIuc/edit), you cut through the noise of imitative products.

Branding your company means you build an established brand for which consumers believe there’s no substitute. It forms cult-like followers for your products.

Unlike mass advertising and other marketing tactics, this long-term approach comes with no expiring date. It creates predictable sales and slashes uncertainty of market change.

By building a strong brand, you create a gulf between your product portfolio and the clutter of the competition.

### III) Advantages of branding in M&A transactions

Brand equity (the perceived worth of a brand in and of itself) plays a significant role when acquirers try to evaluate target firms. That’s because acquirers want to see whether or not the brand can benefit from their position.

And with the [failure rate of M&A transactions is said to be between 70-90%](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-big-idea-the-new-ma-playbook) and that a poorly conceived or executed [M&A destroyed more than $200 billion in shareholder value](https://www.nber.org/digest/aug03/big-firms-lose-value-acquisitions) in 20 years, having brand guidelines as a “**decisional filter**” to check back against is critical.

Will this company solidifies our position in the market? Will it purify or defocus our mission? Do their values and our purpose match or do they contradict each other?

To find a clear answer to questions like these, you need to let your brand's core attributes guide your decisions.

Whether your company is an acquirer or target firm in a potential M&A deal, having an established brand to your company is vital in the pursuit of growth and ROI.

### IV) Building a brand culture creates a non-stop innovation environment

{{% blockquote "Mark Di Somma" %}} Brand culture is the culture that a company cultivates in order to powerfully and consistently deliver its brand to the market. It's how people work together to bring the brand alive for customers.{{% /blockquote %}}

The old spreadsheet-driven business model is insufficient for today’s wicked problems. For companies to increase their innovation, they must build **purposeful** environments in which people thrive and feel valued.

When your staff starts feeling like “another cog in the machine”, their efficiency fizzles out. Scientist’s day-to-day work creates a monotony of mundane activities rather than thrilling ideas to pursue.

As a result, employees go about directionless without understanding the impact of their work or even **why** they do what they do. Thus creating a bureaucratic environment where work overshadows purpose.

Purpose gives your company a true north to head towards. It provides your employees with a reason for why they should fight for the same cause your company is trying to win.

[GlaxoSmithKline](https://hbr.org/2008/05/rebuilding-the-rd-engine-in-big-pharma) was proactive about this and cultivated a purposeful brand to increase the R&D output. Many pharma companies are quick to realize the issue of their size and their effect on staff.

Today, developing a brand culture is imperative.

Brand culture is about developing a purpose-driven company where innovation is predictable rather than accidental. A company where R&D thrives as a consequence of a coherent and unified cause. It’s about establishing a strategic vision for your company and an overarching purpose that orients internal stakeholders.

In his book, Start With The Why, Simon Sinek shares his insight into why some companies flourish and others fail.

He proposes that most companies know **what**, and **how** they do what they do. But very few who know **why** they do what they do.

By which he means why would your company exist besides making a profit? Why would your staff wake up from bed each morning? And what’s the reason behind it?

Companies who can articulate —and are strategically vocal— about their **reason for being**, are the ones that dominate their market. They also tend to be the ones that have skyrocketed operational efficiency.

The reason for this is, when you’re communicating you’re **why** and cultivating a culture around it, you’re embedding a sense of mission into the organization. Your company becomes the playground in which people are motivated by the vision and the purpose your company holds.
