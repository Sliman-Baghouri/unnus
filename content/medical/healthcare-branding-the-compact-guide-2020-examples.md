{{% hook %}}As the pace of healthcare quickens and the number of brands multiplies, it’s patients, not medical businesses, who decide which brands live and which ones die. {{% /hook %}}

An overabundance of look-alike medical brands and me-too services are forcing patients to search for something, anything, to help them separate the winners from the clutter.

Today’s patients seek out brands that create experiences; that intrigue them in a sensorial, emotional, and creative way.

My promise to you is that by the end of reading this article, you’ll have the components of a brand strategy so you can pivot your medical business to a higher level.

A level where profitability is predictable, success is inevitable, and a lasting healthcare brand that empowers its patients.

## **What is healthcare branding?**

Healthcare branding is the management of all components that make a healthcare brand for which patients believe there’s no substitute.

So how do you define a brand?

**A brand is not** your logo, it’s not your ads or marketing campaign. It is not your visual identity, graphics, or business collateral. And It is not the “sum of all impressions from your customer”.

**A brand is** your customer’s feeling towards your brand. It is what makes you unique in the eyes of people. It is a feeling because our judgments and buying decisions are based on trust, not rationality.

As much as we like to say “I base my buying decision on logic”, We don’t. Buying decisions are made by our [limbic system](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/05/02/create-loyal-customers-for-life-making-limbic-connections-with-experiential-branding). The part of the brain that is responsible for decision-making.

### **How to know if you have an established healthcare brand?**

**#\~1) A brand needs to be different**. If a brand is not differentiated, it is not a brand. It is a “me too” service or a product. If you claim to have a brand it needs to be unique in a way that **sets you radically apart**, **adds value**, and **enhances the experience** to your patient.

If you want to put your medical business to the test. Finish the following positioning statement exercise. A seemingly easy but surprisingly hard to finish sentence:

Our Medical Brand Is the only \[Category\] That \[Differentatior\].

**#\~2) The brand has substance.** A brand without purpose is a soulless brand. If your healthcare brand is not purpose-driven people won’t join it. In addition, it should be heading towards a concrete objective or a vision. The word vision/mission is tossed around a lot but much of the so-called “mission/values/vision” are treated as decoration rather than a compass for the brand to follow. And rarely are maintained.

**#\~3) The brand cultivates a community around it.** Your brand does not exist in a vacuum. It needs to be supported by its stakeholders and customers. Your brand will be the ecosystem for the whole team AND the patients to thrive. It will be a playground for increased productivity, innovation, and profitability.

**#\~4) Your brand needs to reflect its audience values.** Your brand should mirror what your patient/audience believes. If your brand does not offer a flattering reflection of its customer’s core values, it will not gain their loyalty. If I’m an overly cautious person and value safety, my go-to hospital will be [healthier™](https://www.unnus.com/case-studies/healthier/), the risk-free hospital. If I’m into enhancing my lifestyle quality, I’ll sign up for The Joint Chiropractic membership. If I want to avoid the dental horror show, my favorite dental practice will be Odentia, the painless dental experience.

**#\~5) Your healthcare brand should carry human attitudes.** Gone are the times where brands communicate their robotic offering and wait for patients to come. “We offer the best care service” Yeah? So does everyone. People now value communication that is infused with humanistic attributes. Your brand should claim a communication voice that is _unique_ to your business. We’ll lay down examples of this approach in the next few sections.

**#\~6) Your brand is aesthetically meaningful.** In an information-rich and time-poor age, aesthetics are the best communication language for your medical business. Great medical brands are not tied with the “blue color + red heart” symbol design. Their aesthetics convey meaning to their patients and sets them apart from the “lookalike” visuals.

If you can check all of the 6 points above, I suggest you do not waste your time reading this article. You are already ahead.

If not, stick around. I’ll provide you with a complete roadmap to revamp your whole practice into a dazzling healthcare brand.

## **Patient cognitive bias and why we favor a medical brand over another**

In his book, Start With The Why, Simon Sinek explains why some brands are more successful than others. He proposes that for brands to have a cult-like loyalty and lead their market, they need to articulate their “why” and be vocal about it.

By “why” he meant your reason for being or your purpose. Why do you do what you do (besides making money) and why would anyone care? It seems an easy task but it is a surprisingly hard feat to accomplish. Most brands know **what** they do, some know **how** they do it, but few who know **why** they do what they do.

The logic for why communicating your purpose is a competitive edge lies in our biological structure. We value meaningful messages more than a robotic, bland value offering. And we make our decision based on how much trust signals we got from said messages.

To illustrate, I’ll use two pitches for a dental practice, one with a **why** message (or a purposeful message) and the other with a **what** message (a simple value offering).

**First (WHAT MESSAGE):**

“_We’re Confidental™, we provide the highest oral care services for our patients at an affordable price. Enjoy a brighter smile!_”

It states who they are, and what they do. Good. It also explains how this benefits patients (affordable prices/brighter smile). Let’s see how this will look when your “why” is well articulated.

**SECOND (WHY MESSAGE):**

“_What good is a smile if you’re nervous about it? Our practice was founded to help patients lead a stress-free lifestyle. The more confident you are, the less stressed your life is. There are many ways to fight anxiety; one is to be confident in your dental appearance. That’s where we come in. We make you confident in your smile._”

Being vocal about the **Why** in the second pitch does one thing that gains you a competitive edge. It influences preference-based judgments about your medical business.

When you use a purposeful message, your communication is perceived by the limbic system, the part of the brain that is responsible for emotions and decision-making.

When your medical brand is purpose-driven, it attracts with meaningful messages rather than pushes with uninspiring marketing.

Being clear on your why create a bias towards your practice and patient will favor your brand no matter who the alternatives are.
