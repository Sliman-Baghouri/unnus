By the end of reading this article, you’ll know why and how to market your orthodontic practice. Not only that, but I’ll share with you what are **branding strategies** and how they boost your marketing effort for maximum profitability.

## **The risk of not being seen in the dental industry**

With the ever-increasing competition from Primary Care Dentists (PCDs) and the rise of DIY dentistry, there’s high pressure on orthodontists to run profitable medical businesses.

In today’s age of accelerated change, depending on referrals from PCDs alone is insufficient. General practitioners are relying on DIY products (Invisalign, anterior braces, or myofunctional appliances) to treat their patients.

Furthermore, the explosion of Dental Support Organizations (DSOs) adds insult to the injury. DSOs often encourage its general practitioners to treat their patients using Products like Six-Months Smile or Smile Direct club, (a mail-order of DIY treatment) and **the thought of referring to an orthodontic specialist outside the corporation for comprehensive brackets and wires is discouraged**.

This results in PCDs overprescribing Invisalign and orthodontists feel pressure to agree to Invisalign treatment out of fear of losing the patient to the PCD.

As an orthodontist, you must increase awareness of the differences between what value you provide and what is being advertised by these companies. You need to educate and communicate with patients _directly_ rather than relying on the referral chain.

And what better way to communicate your values than marketing? Well, marketing works. It increases your “sphere of influence” and **attracts** new patients to you. It can educate your patients on what you have to offer and why they should choose you over others.

However, **orthodontic marketing often falls flat**. Let’s explore why some marketing efforts fail and how you can mitigate that risk.

## **This is why most orthodontic marketing efforts fail**

**Marketing without branding is an accumulation of tactics that comes with an expiration date.**

Most practices over-invest in marketing without building their **brand**. They focus on acquiring _new_ patients rather than retaining current patients.

The problem is that acquiring a new customer is [25 times more expensive ](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers)than retaining an existing one. Dental businesses are focusing on the more expensive ways to generate cash flow.

Patient acquisition _is_ essential, however, acquisition alone is not predictable and not profitable in the long run. You need to shift the focus from acquiring new patients to nurturing relationships with would-be patients.

And to retain and build a cult-like-loyalty for your practice, you need to build a charismatic brand.

**Brand building** is the management of all components that make a brand for which patients believe there’s no substitute.

Branding your dental practice is all about sending trust signals to your patient. This “trust-creation” is the ultimate shortcut to influence buying-decision. We make our decision based on trust and our confidence in the brand.

**_This is not to say that marketing is not important. Just that marketing is more sizable, more profitable, and more dependable when you focus on long term relationships of building your brand instead of short-term revenues._**

## **Orthodontic marketing ideas**

To illustrate how branding strategies can empower your marketing effort, I’ll share with you marketing ideas **combined with branding**.

## **Leverage Social Media (I know. But hear me out…)**

Worry not, this is not your run-of-the-mill “be on social media” type of advice. I’ll share with you creative ways you can supercharge your social media presence.

Social media can be a great channel for two-way communications. You can engage with potential patients, increase your authority, and expand your presence.

**The trap most orthodontic practices fall into** when using social media is that it is more of a “nice to have” rather than a strategy to increase patient volume to the practice.

If you check some of the orthodontic-related Facebook pages or Instagram, you’ll encounter dull “update” messages or the yawn-inducing posts that nobody is willing to react to.

Would-be patients who are in social media are there to have fun. If your posts are bland or medical jargon to them, they won’t follow or engage with you online.

So how do you combat this issue?

Well, a great way to make your posts enjoyable and secure maximum patient engagement with your social pages, is to use a technique called **Brand Voice**.

### **Skyrocket your social media followers Using Brand Voice**

The digital landscape is crowded. It’s filled with chatter from brands and individuals alike. You can only stand out so much based on your visual content, logo, or care services alone. Your written content needs the same attention and consistency you give to the other elements of your brand presence.

A **Brand voice** is an individual style, tone, and language behind all of a brand's communication and messaging. It's a unique way that you communicate who you are, what you do, and who you serve.

The tone of voice should reflect your medical brand’s personality and should be appealing to your target patient. Is your brand’s voice formal or playful? Serious or authoritative? Your communication should be consistent throughout all social media pages.

After defining a brand voice for your brand or social page, you can then **add a dash of** personality to your posts using a unique way of communicating.

To illustrate let’s see some examples:

**#Fridababy,** providing parents tools they need to easily care for their babies.

Their voice in social media is **frisky**, **humorous**, and **unsolicited**

### **Share your practice’s culture on, social media**

Sharing your practice’s culture and work environment in social media adds transparency and builds rapport between you and your potential patients. It’s a great way to attract patients without being too sales-y.
