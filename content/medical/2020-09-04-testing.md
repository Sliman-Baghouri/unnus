As the pace of business quickens and the number of brands multiplies, it’s customers, not companies, who decide which brands live and which ones die.

Nate O' Brian by far has the most fair and realistic review of P2P?

</p>
<p>

Graham certainly did some research but <strong>clearly not enough</strong>. 
</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>

Nate O' Brian by far has the most fair and realistic review of P2P (Second to me of course!).

<h2 class="bold">Importance of how to do it?</h2>

<p>

Graham certainly did some research but <strong>clearly not enough</strong>. 
</p>

<p>
	If you look in his comment section you will actually see my behemoth of a comment.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>

Fees should be taken into account and most platforms show returns AFTER fees but Graham paints this as a horrible factor.

<p>

States that when someone defaults it is bad that only 12-13% of people pay back debt when collected by a third party.

</p>

<p>This is good research, however, <a href="#">defaults should be he states</a>.</p>
<p>

Next he goes onto to state 7.8% default (fail to pay back the loan). 
</p>

<p>Yes, across all quality loans...</p>

<div class="takeaway">
	<h4># KEY TAKEAWAY</h4>
	<p>When analyzing the top-ranking pages, make an effort to assess the overall quality and depth of the content as opposed to looking for traditional indicators of poor optimization (e.g., keyword in the title, etc.). Your job is then to create a better page than those that already rank, not a “better optimized” one.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, don’t try to measure the relevance of page with any kind of “score”—whatever methodology or technology you’re using for that, Google almost certainly isn’t using it.
</p>
</div>


<p>

Liquidity, yes, he is right the loan  P2P as a whole a "BAD" investment instrument. 

</p>

<p>

I will be careful with this one Graham does use the words "most" and "potentially" so he is being honest of course, I just think he does not have a full understanding of how this all works 

</p>

<p>

<b>BIGGEST ISSUE</b>, it seems his judgement of P2P Lending as a whole like many reviews (which we will get to soon), is based on only one platform, in this case Lending Club. 

</p>

<p>

Default rates will go up during a recession, yes, however large.

<section id="Whataretheseproblems">

<h2>What are these problems</h2>

<p>

Taxes, while this is different in Australia and is less of a problem as our tax system does not discriminate based on income type like is such in America he still makes a good point.

</p>

<p>

Lending Club does have a bad reputation, yes, However this brings me right back to point 6. 

</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Again, an investment not being liquid does not mean it is a bad investment.

</p>

<p>

States the business has it better than consumer with fees, yes they do. They put in the work starting the business, same reason any business owner makes more than an employee.

</p>

<p>

Again, defaults and fees should be calculated BEFORE investing.

</p>

<p>

States unlike stocks you can invest in multiple companies, what is stopping you from investing in multiple platforms as I do? 

</p>

<div class="note">
	<p>When analyzing the top-ranking pages, make an effort to assess the overall quality and depth of the content 	optimization.</p>
</div>
<p>

Yes, fraud possibly occurred but this also happened 1000x over in companies throughout history all over the world. This is again referring to one platform. 

</p>
