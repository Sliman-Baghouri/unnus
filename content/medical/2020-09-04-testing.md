FCWhen analyzing the top-ranking pages, make an effort to assess the overall quality and depth of the content as opposed to looking for traditional indicators of poor optimization (e.g., keyword in the title, etc.). Your job is then to create a better page than those that already rank, not a “better optimized” one.

XFurthermore, don’t try to measure the relevance of page with any kind of “score”—whatever methodology or technology you’re using for that, Google almost certainly isn’t using it.
