<section id="Introduction">
	
<p>I’d like to share with you one of my favorite passages:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
	
“There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it.

Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. By WHY I mean your purpose, cause or belief - WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?

People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.”
</p>
   
<cite>― Simon Sinek, Start with Why</cite>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p> I'm sure you've seen this:</p>

<p> <em> “Providing you quality care” </em><br><em> “Cutting edge technology” </em><br><em> “Best in class”</em><br><em>“Data-driven approach”</em><br><em> “Innovative care services”</em></p>

Go ahead and profile 3 of the closest medical businesses to you

A quick rundown of their about section, and you’ll notice:

<b>Core values:</b>

Responsibility, Passion, Quality care, Accountability, [copy & paste any synonym that’s remotely related].

<b>Our mission is to</b>

[let me guess, deliver compassionate care? provide world-class services? patient-centric care?]

<b>We are committed to</b> 

[improve the health of your community? provide an unparalleled experience? Treating people with integrity?]

<b>Our vision is to </b>

[be the place of choice for patients? Leadership in healthcare?]

You get the point

</section>
<section id="DangerOfLookalikeHealthcareBrands">

Everything looks the same you wonder if choosing a practice name creates distinguish

And I’m aware, these values are noble, undoubtedly so.

Healthcare should aim for them, and this, I vouch for.

However, having them as a decoration for an unvisited web page on your website is the wrong way to go about it.

It is a surefire way to submerge your practice in a sea of “lookalike” healthcare brands.

Besides, these overused claims are bland, yawn-inducing, and not specific enough.



<b>Here’s what muddies the water even more:</b>


When your <b>“why”</b> or values are broadly defined, you run the risk of not having systematic steps to hit your business goals.

And because there is no shortage of people using the same headlines, statements, uninspiring marketing, ads...

Your audience will perceive you as “yet another healthcare institution/practice”.

And by blending into what everyone is doing, you commoditize your care services

<b>In a crowded marketplace like healthcare, not standing out is the same as being invisible</b>.


You can’t establish a strong foothold in the market or increase your profit margins if you don’t establish a position/differentiator.

I’ll illustrate with a real-world example.

</section>

<section id="CaseStudy">
	
<a target="_blank" href="/case-studies/healthier">Healthier</a>, a community hospital, based in Orlando.

Healthier reached us out to differentiate themselves in a competitive environment.

After a collaborative work and research, we decided that healthier will rebrand itself as the <b>safest</b> in florida.


They didn’t announce it to the world, <em>they became it</em>.

All the touchpoints, nurses, physicians, web copy, receptionist, press, advertising, social media, all together—yelled <b>safety</b>.

Without fail, every contact point emphasizes precautions, safety, protection, security, and welfare.

If you read their blog, they solely talk about lowering medical errors, preventing patient falls, reducing readmission rates, and leading a healthier lifestyle.

They utilize predictive models to help identify patients who may be at risk for certain conditions in the future.

And combating that with preventative practices that can delay or reduce the likelihood of the symptoms.


Even in the brand name, tone of voice, logo, website, color schemes, and marketing, all connote safety first.

Laser-focusing on being healthy rather than treating patients with leading-edge tech.

If you ask patients about the hospital, the #1 thing they remember it for is, how risk-free the hospital was.

And via the act of constant stress on leading a healthier life and being safe first, they are the safest option to their patients.

And people know it.


The <b>“why”</b> / the mission statement they developed, acted as a decision-guide to their actions.

And by being specific and focusing on one thing, they achieved a higher goal, quality care.

They own the “safest hospital” title.

This happens when your <b>why</b> is maintained and your values/beliefs are actively managed. 

If you do not actively work to keep clarity, discipline and consistency in balance, then trust starts to break down. 

Granted, some may start with the why, but only the great ones that systematically keep their why clear year after year.

At the simplest level, you want your medical business to be purpose-backed 

Your marketing channels, staff, and the doctor giving care, all need to be on the same page. 

You need everyone to be on the same wavelength delivering a consistent patient experience 

The garage guy needs to say something like “I work in the parking lot of a place that’s on this <b>mission</b>”.
</section>


<section id="ProblemWithSettingBroadGoalsAndObjectives">
	
<h3>Steer clear from vaguely defined goals</h3>

For values or guiding principles to be effective they have to be specific. 

If you aim for quality care, illustrate your why and—be piercingly precise about it.

Patients should see and feel your values, not skim through them.

Having a brand substance like mission/vision/value is crucial.

And will drive raving fans to your practice if they are well developed and novel enough.

It is a winning ticket to a successful healthcare brand and a cheat code breakthrough the clutter.  

</section>

<b>Next up:</b> I’ll be covering how you can methodically take your values and your “why” to create a practical strategy for establishing yourself as the better— and well deserving— alternative, to potential patients.
