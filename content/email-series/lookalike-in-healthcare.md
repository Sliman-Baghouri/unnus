<section id="Introduction">
	
<p class="hookParagraph">I’d like to share with you one of my favorite passages:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>“There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it.</p>

<p>Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. By WHY I mean your purpose, cause or belief - WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?
</p>

<p>
	
People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.”
</p>

   
<p><cite>― Simon Sinek, Start with Why</cite></p>

<p> I'm sure you've seen this:</p>

<p> <em> “Providing you quality care” </em><br><em> “Cutting edge technology” </em><br><em> “Best in class”</em><br><em>“Data-driven approach”</em><br><em> “Innovative care services”</em></p>
<p>
Go ahead and profile 3 of the closest medical businesses to you
</p>
<p>
A quick rundown of their about section, and you’ll notice:
</p>
<p>
	
<b>Core values:</b>
</p>
<p>
	Responsibility, Passion, Quality care, Accountability, [copy & paste any synonym that’s remotely related].
</p>

<p>
	
<b>Our mission is to</b>
</p>
<p>
	
[let me guess, deliver compassionate care? provide world-class services? patient-centric care?]
</p>
<p>
	
<b>We are committed to</b> 
</p>
<p>
	
[improve the health of your community? provide an unparalleled experience? Treating people with integrity?]
</p>
<p>
	
<b>Our vision is to </b>
</p>
<p>
	
[be the place of choice for patients? Leadership in healthcare?]
</p>
<p>
	
You get the point
</p>

<p>
	
Everything looks the same you wonder if choosing a practice name creates distinguish
</p>
</section>
<section id="DangerOfLookalikeHealthcareBrands">
<h2>Danger of blending in</h2>

<p>
	
Now, I’m aware, the values/missions statement above are noble, undoubtedly so.
</p>
<p>
	
Healthcare <em>should</em> aim for them, and this, I vouch for.
</p>
<p>
	
However, having them as a decoration for an unvisited web page on your website is the wrong way to go about it.
</p>
<p>
	
It is a surefire way to submerge your practice in a sea of “lookalike” healthcare brands.
</p>
<p>
	
Besides, these overused claims are bland, yawn-inducing, and not specific enough.
</p>

<p>
	
<b>Here’s what muddies the water even more:</b>
</p>

<p>
	
When your <b>“why”</b> or values are broadly defined, you run the risk of not having systematic steps to hit your business goals.
</p>

<p>
	
And because there is no shortage of people using the same headlines, statements, uninspiring marketing, ads...
</p>
<p>
	
Your audience will perceive you as “yet another healthcare institution/practice”.
</p>
<p>
	
And by blending into what everyone is doing, you commoditize your care services
</p>
<p>
	
<b>In a crowded marketplace like healthcare, not standing out is the same as being invisible</b>.
</p>

<p>
	
You can’t establish a strong foothold in the market or increase your profit margins if you don’t establish a position/differentiator.
</p>
<p>
	
I’ll illustrate with a real-world example.
</p>

</section>

<section id="CaseStudy">
	<h2>Case Study: Healthier, Safest hospital in town</h2>
	<p>
		
<a target="_blank" href="/case-studies/healthier">Healthier</a>, a community hospital, based in Orlando.
	</p>
<p>
	
Healthier reached us out to differentiate themselves in a competitive environment.
</p>
<p>
	
After a collaborative work and research, we decided that healthier will rebrand itself as the <b>safest</b> place for its patients.
</p>
<p>
	
They didn’t announce it to the world, <em>they became it</em>.
</p>

<p>
	
All the touchpoints, nurses, physicians, web copy, receptionist, press, advertising, social media, all together—yelled <b>safety</b>.
</p>
<p>
	
Without fail, every contact point emphasizes precautions, safety, protection, security, and welfare.
</p>
<p>
	
If you read their blog, they solely talk about lowering medical errors, preventing patient falls, reducing readmission rates, and leading a healthier lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
	
They utilize predictive models to help identify patients who may be at risk for certain conditions in the future.
</p>
<p>
	
And combating that with preventative practices that can delay or reduce the likelihood of the symptoms.
</p>

<p>
	
Even in the brand name, tone of voice, logo, website, color schemes, and marketing, all connote safety first.
</p>
<p>
	
Laser-focusing on being healthy rather than treating patients with leading-edge tech.
</p>
<p>
	
If you ask patients about the hospital, the #1 thing they remember it for is, how risk-free the hospital was.
</p>
<p>
	
And via the act of constant stress on leading a healthier life and being safe first, they are the safest option to their patients.
</p>
<p>
	
And people know it.
</p>

<p>
	
The <b>“why”</b> / the mission statement they developed, acted as a decision-guide to their actions.
</p>
<p>
	
And by being specific and focusing on one thing, they achieved a higher goal, quality care.
</p>
<p>
	
They own the “safest hospital” title.
</p>
<p>
	
This happens when your <b>why</b> is maintained and your values/beliefs are actively managed. 
</p>
<p>
	
If you do not actively work to keep clarity, discipline and consistency in balance, then trust starts to break down. 
</p>
<p>
	
Granted, some may start with the why, but only the great ones that systematically keep their why clear year after year.
</p>
<p>
	
At the simplest level, you want your medical business to be purpose-backed 
</p>
<p>
	
Your marketing channels, staff, and the doctor giving care, all need to be on the same page. 
</p>
<p>
	
You need everyone to be on the same wavelength delivering a consistent patient experience 
</p>
<p>
	
The garage guy needs to say something like “I work in the parking lot of a place that’s on this <b>mission</b>”.
</p>
</section>


<section id="ProblemWithSettingBroadGoalsAndObjectives">
	
<h2>Steer clear from vaguely defined goals</h2>
<p>
	
For values or guiding principles to be effective they have to be specific. 
</p>
<p>
	
If you aim for quality care, illustrate your why and—be piercingly precise about it.
</p>
<p>
	
Patients should see and feel your values, not skim through them.
</p>
<p>
	
Having a brand substance like mission/vision/value is crucial.
</p>
<p>
	
And will drive raving fans to your practice if they are well developed and novel enough.
</p>
<p>
	
It is a winning ticket to a successful healthcare brand and a cheat code breakthrough the clutter.  
</p>

</section>
<p>
	
<b>Next up:</b> I’ll be covering how you can methodically take your values and your “why” to create a practical strategy for establishing yourself as the better— and well deserving— alternative, to potential patients.
