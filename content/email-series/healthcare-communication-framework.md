<section id="Introduction">
<div class="hook">
	
<p>Today, you'll look at how to establish a memorable patient experience using techniques such as storytelling, messaging, and more&hellip;</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I will illustrate with examples to depict the practicality of this section.</p>
<p>You will also extract the essence of your brand and voice it to the public in a refined way.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>And for that, we&rsquo;ll need to establish a<strong> communication framework</strong>.</p>
<p>What is a communication framework and why do you need it?</p>
<p>Think of it as a guide to your medical brand and everyone who&rsquo;s involved in it.</p>
<p>And I mean everyone: receptionists, nurses, the doctor giving care, the advertising campaigns, website, logo, social media pages...</p>
<p>You want consistency.</p>
<p>And this framework will direct all contact points your patient has with your medical brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are five components to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Core Message</strong></li>
<li><strong> Secondary messages</strong></li>
<li><strong> Brand Storytelling </strong></li>
<li><strong> Tagline </strong></li>
<li><strong> Hooks + Pitch</strong></li>
<li><strong> Brand Naming</strong></li>
</ol>

<section id="Formingcoremessage">
	
<h2>#1 Core Message</h2>
<p>A Core Message is what you want your patients to know about your medical brand and how it <strong>benefits</strong> them.</p>
<p>And Secondary Messages are the core message, dissected to pieces.</p>
<p>Multiple secondary messages make up your whole core message</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you run a chiropractic clinic</p>
<p>A core message with a secondary messages might be as follows</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/example/cf-e.jpg" alt="Brand voice example 2 in healthcare" />
<p>To start forming your core message</p>
<p>You:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by formulating a core message</li>
<li>Sum up your message in one concise sentence</li>
<li>deconstruct that core message into various secondary messages</li>
</ol>
<p>Why use secondary messages? Because you want to make your communication easy to digest for patients</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t describe what your medical brand is all about using one repetitive message.</p>
<p>Instead, block by block, you nurture your potential patients about your brand.</p>
<p>This will make it easier for people to take-in your values and your position in the market.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also use them to integrate storytelling and convey your medical brand to your patients</p>
<p>How? read on</p>

<h2>#2 Healthcare Brand Storytelling</h2>
<p>People, by nature, digest stories with ease.</p>
<p>For that, we&rsquo;ll use storytelling tactics.</p>
<p>Storytelling is conveying your brand story using multiple snippets in your communication.</p>
<p>These small sets of stories will inform patients about your position in the market.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take your secondary-messages and construct small stories around them.</p>
<p>Seems vague?</p>
<p>Let me use a real-world case from one of our clients.</p>
<p>Our client had a community hospital and we were running a maternity marketing campaign.</p>
<p>After the research, we found that women experienced great chaos.</p>
<p>From navigating the obstetrics medical process to the unsolicited advice.</p>
<p>Women dealt with the expertise of her &ldquo;all-knowing&rdquo; friends and relatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re carrying high&mdash;it must be a boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Add to that the conflicting information she reads in books</p>
<p>All this led to confusion, stress and <strong>feeling out of control</strong></p>
<p>Knowing that we chose a core message for the campaign to be</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shape your own birth experience&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This message carries multiple ideas, such:</p>
<ol>
<li>Empowerment of pregnant women</li>
<li>Personalized birth experience</li>
<li>Staying in charge and be in the know of your situation</li>
</ol>
<p>we took these secondary messages and made marketing campaigns for each one of them.</p>
<p>The simplified process looked like this</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/example/cf-example-3.jpg" alt="Brand voice example 3 in healthcare" />
<p>Each marketing channel, articles, social posts, eBooks, brochures, told a specific story.</p>
<p>The story of the confusions pregnant women went through, and how they felt out of control.</p>
<p>And in these channels, we inject what solutions our community hospital has to offer.</p>
<p>Each one of the media posts is laser-focused on one problem, provided one solution, and told one story.</p>
<p>These small sets of posts, messages, and ads, all pile up together to form the whole core message, &ldquo;<strong>shape your own birth experience</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here at unnus, we use a storytelling techniques or a derivative version of it whenever we can</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m using a simplified version of it as I write this.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that each part starts with a promise?</p>
<p>Then I proceed to evoke your curiosity of how to find an answer to other questions</p>
<p>Mid-article I discuss possible solutions</p>
<p>And I end the whole lesson in a conclusion that is valuable to you.</p>
<p>We don't take our reader's time lightly</p>
<p>We know that you are a busy professionals and the last thing you want is a dull read</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t go out of my way to throw a bunch of text and send it over to you and call it a day.</p>
<p>This is the power of storytelling&mdash;it makes your messages memorable to your patients.</p>
<p>You can leverage this technique by &mdash;asynchronously&mdash; feeding your patients with small sets of stories.</p>

<h2>#3 Tagline</h2>
<p>Taglines aren&rsquo;t made up catchwords someone use only for the sake of being playful.</p>
<p>The role of a great tagline is to develop a &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; in the heads of your patients.</p>
<p>It will sum up the tone and premise of your care services</p>
<p>while at the same time reinforce and strengthen the patient&rsquo;s memory of your practice.</p>
</section>

<section id="Hooksandpitches">
	
<h2>#4 Hooks + Pitch</h2>
<p>Think of this step as the crisp articulation of your differentiating skills and your unique value proposition</p>
<p>It is how you present yourself at work, and how people know what you bring to the table</p>
<p>Additionally, it arms you and your staff with <strong>succinct phrases</strong> around your medical brand</p>
</section>

<section id="Choosingapropername">
<h2>#5 Brand naming</h2>
<p>this is where everything comes down to.</p>
<p>You will summarize all the research and strategies in your brand name</p>
<p>Your brand name will encompass everything you represent and what you have to offer to the market.</p>
<p>As simple as it might sound, picking a name is one of the hardest parts in constructing authentic brands</p>
<p>Because you have to take into account everything you stand for and compress it in one memorable, &mdash;preferably&mdash; easy to pronounce name.</p>
<p>Depending on whether you already have a brand name or not, this step is optional.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that a name backed by strategic planning will have better chances to stick with your patients.</p>
