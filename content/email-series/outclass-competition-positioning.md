<section id="Introduction">
<div class="hook">
<p>I'm sure you've seen it:</p>
<p>People crazily attached to a certain brand over another. </p>
<p>IOS vs Android / Microsoft vs Apple / Toyota vs Honda</p>
<p>In branding, this is planned.</p>
<p>So how applicable is this in healthcare? And how to achieve it?</p>
</div>



<hr>

<p>Today, I’ll start with the first few tactics to achieve the same patient loyalty/retention to your practice.</p>
<p>In addition, you’ll render any competition—irrelevant.</p>
<p>You’ll align your business with the selected people (ideal patients) who are more likely to choose your services.</p>
<p>This “alignment” is what we call <strong>Positioning</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>“Positioning does not seek to beat the competition. Instead, it aims to make the competition irrelevant”</p>
	<cite><p>― W. Chan Kim</p></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Positioning is where your care service stands <strong>in relation to</strong> others offering similar services&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about perception&mdash; how patients will perceive your medical brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you create the perception, you back it up by the service&rsquo;s real, demonstrable attributes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unemotional, arms-length exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any positioning strategy consists of 4 main stages:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Audience Persona</li>
<li>Differentiation Strategy</li>
<li>Positioning Statement Development</li>
</ul>
<p>As we go over them, you’ll uncover the untapped opportunities each one has to offer you. </p>

<h2>#1 Research: your plans should not be based on unsupported hunches</h2>
<p>Research is of the utmost importance in this part of the process</p>
<p><b>A) S.W.O.T analysis</b></p>
<p>While it might sound like you&rsquo;re calling on a hostage-rescue law enforcement team, S.W.OT is a planning technique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It identifies the <strong>strengths</strong>, <strong>weaknesses</strong>, <strong>opportunities</strong>, and <strong>threats</strong> related to your medical business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>S.W.O.T makes it easy to identify the weak parts of your business and reverse them to your advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great benefit of this analysis is that it opens up a window of opportunities that none of your competition sees</p>
<p>Example of S.W.O.T Analysis for a healthcare business:</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/swot-analysis-in-healthcare.jpg" alt="S.W.O.T Analysis in healthcare" />
<p><b>B) Market Research</b></p>
<p>Think of market research as an organized effort to gather information about your target patients/audience.</p>
<p>Conducting market research gives you a bird&rsquo;s view of your market as a whole, including other providers.</p>
<p>It solidifies your understanding of what is working and what is not.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>C) Competitor analysis&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>In this part of the research, you need to turn yourself into an unbiased patient looking for the best providers.</p>
<p>Doing so enables you to spot the area of improvement and what your competitors are doing well</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can also conduct a S.W.O.T analysis of competitors to get a clear picture of their performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;There are a lot of competitor analysis techniques but to save time, we will keep it at that.</p>

<h2>#2 Developing your patient's persona</h2>
<p>Some patients are a delight.</p>
<p>They arrive at appointments on time, pay you promptly, and enjoy immediate results from your services.</p>
<p>But other patients aren&rsquo;t a good fit at all.</p>
<p>They arrive late to appointments, complain about your rates, don&rsquo;t respect your policies and procedures, or disagree with your fundamental philosophy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why attracting the right people to your business is crucial</p>
<p>And patient persona is the immediate answer to this issue</p>
<p>Personas are fictional profiles that represent groups of similar people in a target audience.</p>
<p>When you have a profound idea of who are your ideal patients, you&rsquo;ll be able to <strong>align your messaging</strong> (we'll go into this later) to what resonates with their core values&nbsp;</p>
<p>After gathering enough data from your research, develop a real-life example of your ideal patient</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s an example</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<section id="Differentiationstrategy">
<h2>#3 Differentiation strategy</h2>
<p>After recording the information from each of your <strong>competitor&rsquo;s analysis</strong>, we review their data in detail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that there is a sea of unmet needs and gaps that you can take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that data, we analyze these market gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any unmet needs we can meet to create a unique point of difference?</p>
<p>After going through all the market gaps, we score them out of 10.</p>
<p>The lower the number, the wider the market gap</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/unmet-needs-and-gaps.jpg" alt="Healthcare market unmet needs table" />
<p>You can use the&nbsp;<a href=" #" target="_blank">spreadsheet provided here</a>&nbsp;to organize your data</p>
<p>Next, we start by developing a <strong>differentiator</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A differentiator is:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What your care service delivers <strong><em>differently</em></strong> compared to others</li>
<li>That <strong><em>adds</em></strong> value to your patients</li>
<li>And provide <strong><em>enhanced</em> </strong>patient experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to find at least 3 viable differentiators and score them out of 10.</p>
<p>The higher the number, the greater the opportunities</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/differentiator-table.jpg" alt="differentiator table tool" />
<p>(Again, I attached worksheet that will make this quick and easy)</p>
</section>

<section id="Developingapositioningstatement">
<h2>#4 Positioning statement development</h2>
<p>All the work we have done is to develop a positioning statement and an USP (unique selling proposition).&nbsp;</p>
<p>USP is a clear statement that describes the benefit of your care services.</p>
<p>It announces how you solve your patient <strong>unmet needs</strong> differently.</p>
<p>The goal here is to highlight your practice&rsquo;s most powerful attributes.</p>
<p>Attributes no competitor can claim and that are valuable to your&nbsp;</p>
<p>patients.</p>
<p>Use the provided structure in the attached worksheet to create a USP statement&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the USP Template:</strong></p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/USP-Template.jpg" alt="USP Template" />
<p><strong>And here’s the Positioning Statement template:</strong></p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/Positioning-Statement-Template.jpg" alt="Positioning Statement Template" />
<p><strong>How About an example?</strong></p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/Positioning-Statement-Full-Example.jpg" alt="Positioning Statement Example" />
<p><b>Important:</b> these positioning statements will not be available to the public or your patients. Expressing your positioning in a refined way to your audience will be the topic for the next lesson.</p>
