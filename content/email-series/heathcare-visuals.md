<section id="Introduction">
<div class="hook">
<p>Our brains are wired to react to things that have meaning before they construct the perceptions of objects</p>
<p>Which means, you perceive the <em>meaning of things</em> then, and only then, you see the visual elements of it.</p>
</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give an example:</p>
<p>When you approach a cliff, you don&rsquo;t see a cliff.</p>
<p>You see a <strong>falling off place</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;falling-off&rdquo; perception that comes first to mind, then you&rsquo;ll see the imagery aspect of the object, that is, the actual &ldquo;cliff&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Another example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you see a muscular, in-shape person, you don&rsquo;t see a &ldquo;hot and well-built person" your brain perceives that as a "healthy body" or "Strong potential partner&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for that is, the meanings of things are more real.</p>
<p>And the same can be applied to your medical business and its visual identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual identity is the look and aesthetics of your branding assets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call <strong>external branding</strong></p>
<p>External branding consists of office design, logotypes, typography, website, referral pads, color schemes, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Great visual identity will reflect <em>and</em> give <strong>meaning</strong> to your medical business</p>
<p>It makes your services premium and modern.</p>
<p>Conversely, predictable/outdated visuals commoditize your care services.</p>
<p>And since humans are visual beings, when we make our buying decision, we will favor what either:</p>
<ul>
<li>looks aesthetically pleasing</li>
<li>Or reflect our core values</li>
<li>Or convey meaning to us through well-designed illustrations</li>
</ul>
<p>So, do your visuals give the meaning you want your patients to perceive of you?</p>
<p>More importantly, does it mirror your internal branding?</p>

<h2>Are you wearing the same dress as the others?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a challenge:</p>
<p>Open up a 3 hospital or any practice websites</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a rough outline of what you&rsquo;ll stumble upon:</p>
<p>*Blue/green/red color scheme*</p>
<p>*logo of a plus sign/heart/caduceus/leaf/hands etc.*</p>
<p>*motionless picture of doctors in white coats smiling*</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a specific field, let&rsquo;s say dentistry, you&rsquo;ll be faced with the usual &ldquo;smile&rdquo; derivatives and so on.</p>
<p>You can notice the same patterns if you visited any clinic or medical office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is by far, the most underutilized branding aspect in healthcare.</p>
<p>Your visual identity should not be a replica of other practices.</p>
<p>Wearing the same dress in a crowded room is the same as hiding yourself.</p>
<p>Visuals are the <em>first</em> communication channel you have with your patients.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no second impression.</p>
<p>If you look like everyone else, you'll be put on the patient's mental box of "Brands that I won&rsquo;t remember&rdquo;.</p>
</section>
<section id="Marryinginternalbrandingwithexternalbranding">
<h2>Marrying your internal branding with your external branding</h2>
<p>If your competitor&rsquo;s visuals look the same, yours should glitter.</p>
<p>So, how do you go about making it stand out?</p>
<p>One way is to <strong>mirror</strong> your internal branding.</p>
<p>Your visuals should reflect your positioning in the market and core philosophy.</p>
<p>To illustrate I&rsquo;ll give an example:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you own a dental practice called <strong>Confidental</strong><strong>&trade;</strong></p>
<p>You noticed that your competitors are squeezing the air out of the &ldquo;have-a-better-smile&rdquo; statements.</p>
<p>So, to differentiate your brand, you put a brand strategy in place.</p>
<p>During the branding workshop, the folks over Confidental&trade; spot an insightful observation:</p>
<p><strong><em>Most of the patients didn&rsquo;t book a visit to get &ldquo;premium oral care&rdquo;. They go to the dentist because they wanted to eradicate self-consciousness.</em></strong></p>
<p>Sure, a crooked or chipped tooth is a &ldquo;reason&rdquo; for why they went there.</p>
<p>However, getting rid of that issue is a means to an end&mdash;to be more confident in their dental appearance.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing this, you positioned Confidental&trade; as <strong>the only dental practice that focuses on its patient&rsquo;s confidence. </strong></p>
<p>The Confidental&trade; brand stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidence and certitude</li>
<li>Fostering self-regard for its patients</li>
<li>Assurance and reliance</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how can you portray these values visually to potential patients?</p>

<h2>Enters: Visualization Process (VP)</h2>
<p><strong>VP</strong> is the act of generating visual aspects of a brand based on its core attribute and positioning.</p>
<p>Meaning, you take what differentiate your brand in the market, then create an imagery perception that <strong>fits</strong> it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how well that plays in our Confidental&trade; example.</p>
<p>After deciding on a strategy, you go through the visualization process with your team.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization </strong>has 3 stages</p>
<ol>
<li>Brand Keyword Disbandment</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
<li>Creative Process</li>
</ol>
<h4>1) Brand Keyword Disbandment (BKD)</h4>
<p>In this stage, you gather up all the keywords that are related to your brand and categorize them as seen below</p>
<p>Confidental&trade; Brand keywords will look something like this:</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/brand-essence-keywords.png" alt="Brand Keyword Disbandment Example" />
<p>After that, highlight 3-6 keywords that truthfully represent your medical business and its positioning.</p>
<p>In this case, Confidental&trade; has 6 keywords that authentically encapsulate the whole brand: Confidence, Enabling, Empowering, Reliable, Empathetic, and Encouraging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save time, we&rsquo;ll use only 3 keywords and move on to the next process.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2) Visualization</h4>
<p>In this stage, we will take the 3 keywords from the last step and give them a visual element.</p>
<p>Think of it as putting a &ldquo;dress&rdquo; on these keywords</p>
<p>You see, here is where meaning intersects with design.</p>
<p>For example, the visual aspect of the word &ldquo;<strong>class</strong>&rdquo; will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical: </strong>&ldquo;class&rdquo; indicates that something is <strong>Elegant Looking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emotional:</strong> &ldquo;class&rdquo; gives the sense of a <strong>Charm</strong> or<strong> Politeness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Descriptive: </strong>&ldquo;Class&rdquo; describes something <strong>Traditional </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We will do the same thing for each of the 3 keywords we have chosen for Confidental&trade;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/visualization.jpg" alt="visualization process example" />
<p>This will guide your team when designing the actual visual identity for your medical brand. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>3) Creative Process</h4>
<p>Now that we have the general sense of how Confidental&trade; visual identity will look like, we processed to the creative process.</p>
<p>In this stage, your team will decide how your external branding will look <strong>based</strong> on what your brand means to your patients.</p>
<p>Things like logo, website, business cards, images, videos, collateral, booklets, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Each one will carry along little substance of your brand and express it to your patients in a visual way.</p>
<p>Think of your external branding as an "optical communication" with your patients.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll take the <strong>visual aspects</strong> of your brand's most representative keywords (which we got from the last step) and create a general theme for it.</p>
<p>Confidental&trade; Outlook theme will look something like:</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/creative-process.jpg" alt="Creative Process Example" />
<p>The powerful element of this strategy is that it is tailored specifically to your medical business.</p>
<p>No one can claim your visual identity in the market</p>
<p>And best of all, your identity carries with it meaning. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;yet-another-med-brand&rdquo; kind of work.</p>

<section id="Thetruthaboutvisuals">
<h2>The truth about visuals and biases</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit.</p>
<p>Not once, not twice, but multiple times I based my buying decision on the visual element alone.</p>
<p>If I see something that is sleek dark, sharp, and premium looking, it whispers:</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Hey this is a luxurious product, it reflects what you desire. Let people know that this is part of you&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>And I buy it without a second thought.</p>
<p>In the case of Confidental&trade;, they do offer the best oral care.</p>
<p>But, what they sell is not dental expertise, they sell <strong>confidence.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Which one you think is more appealing?</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I trust that this course was worth your time.</p>
