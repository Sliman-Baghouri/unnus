<p>There are a ton of tropes and clichés about medicine and those who practice it.</p>
<p>Which leads patients to an unintended, nonverbal bias in their interactions with your medical brand.</p>
<p>Today, we'll break the mold of these stereotypes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is brand persona and how it benefit you</li>
	<li>Infusing substance and emotions to your medical brand</li>
	<li>Finding a "voice" that suits your brand</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a brand persona?</h2>
<p>Brand persona is the act of collecting personality traits, attitudes, and values that your brand will showcase regularly</p>
<p>All traits will be prominent in your patient's contact points with your brand. (think website/marketing/nurses/doctor giving care...)</p>
<p>This will tighten the connections your patient-segment has with you.</p>
<p>A good persona is one that you can almost visualize as someone you know and could talk to.</p>
<p>Your brand&rsquo;s attributes will perfectly adjust to what your patients associate with the most.</p>
<p>Hence, creating patient loyalty and increasing their retention.</p>

	<p>Brand Personality adds spirit and a soul to what would otherwise be a robotic, automated, generic price-value proposition.</p>

<h2>Creating Patient and Brand Personas</h2>
<p>When creating a brand persona, you have to take into account what&rsquo;s the <strong>archetype</strong> of both your patient and medical brand.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an archetype?</p>
<p><strong>An archetype is a typical character that represents universal patterns of human nature.</strong></p>
<p>Assigning this typical character to your medical brand guides your communication with patients.</p>
<p>When you need to visualize your ideal patient, an archetype is irreplaceable.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="#">According to Psychologist Carl Jung</a> who coined the term in the early 20th century there are twelve brand archetypes: <br><br> The Innocent, Everyman, Hero, Outlaw, Explorer, Creator, Ruler, Magician, Lover, Caregiver, Jester, and Sage.</p>
<p>Interested in more details? <a target="_blank" href="#">I attached an Archetypes Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the details of each one</p>
<p>Instead, I'll illustrate with an example:</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that your target patients are pregnant women and your hospital help deliver babies.</p>
<p>Your patient (mothers-to-be) their archetype will be the caregiver <strong>(an archetype that is driven by the desire to protect and care for their children)</strong></p>
<p>So, your brand <em>needs</em> to be a caregiver type: meaning, your communication channels are soft-spoken/reassuring.</p>
<p>Your messaging will hit home with what they are currently experiencing.</p>
<p>Identifying the characteristics and desires your patient they'll most align with, is critical.</p>
<p>It arms you with a clear picture of what archetype your medical brand needs to be</p>

<h2>Brand voice and tone/language</h2>
<p>Brand voice is the personality and emotion infused into the language you use with your targeted patients, either online or offline.</p>
<p>It encompasses everything your patients come in touch with.</p>
<p>from the words and language, you use to the personality and image your marketing/copy aim to invoke.</p>
<p>For example, on a web page about cancer, you will have the same voice about your medical brand, but you may be softer and more reassuring.</p>
<p>On a web page about having a baby, the copy will be more excited and congratulatory.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take some examples:</p>
<p>Arnold Palmer Hospital:</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/example/brand-voice-1.png" alt="Brand voice example in healthcare" />
<p>When defining your voice, you should know who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Arnold Palmer Hospital does throughout its website.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s talking to worried moms and dads.</p>
<p>Their voice is reassuring and realistic.</p>
<p>Dignity Health&rsquo;s:</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/example/brand-voice-2.png" alt="Brand voice example 2 in healthcare" />
<p>You forget you&rsquo;re looking at a hospital website when you read their heartwarming headline.</p>
<p>A simplified process of brand voice development will look like this:</p>

<p>Here at unnus, we like to go the extra mile with our clients and perform a technique we call <strong>brand interview</strong>.</p>
<p>After we finished finalizing persona, we start by asking questions and answering them based on the brand persona of our clients</p>
<p>Here's an example from one of our clients in the dental industry</p>
<img src="/assets/course-assets/brand-interview.jpg" alt="Brand interview example in dental industry" />


<p>This solidifies our understanding of the brand and how we voice it to our client&rsquo;s patients.</p>
<p><strong>Next up:</strong> I'll go on about how to communicate everything we&rsquo;ve done so far (your positioning, brand persona, values) publicly to your ideal patients with a coherent framework.</p>
