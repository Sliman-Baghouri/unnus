	<h3>how much of business growth are you missing out on by <em>not</em>&nbsp; implementing these strategies?</h3>
	<p>By really focusing on differentiating your practice, you provide a <strong>value beyond your care services.</strong></p>
	<p>The next question you needs to answer is:</p>
	<p><em>What are the practical steps to take in order to expand and build my healthcare brand?</em></p>

<h3>We’d like to introduce you to our Healthcare Brand Intensive Service</h3>
<p>here’s how it works:</p>

<div class="process">
	<h4>I) We'll schedule a free consultation:</h4>
	<p>We'll learn a bit more about you and your practice, and We’ll ask you for a few data points that will help us better understand what we’re looking at.</p>
</div>
<div class="process">
	<h4>II) During our session:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>we’ll tear apart your current positioning, target audience, competitors, the patients you want to target etc.</li>
		<li>We’ll also get a solid understanding of the experience that you are providing patients.</li>
		<li>The goal is to fully understand your practice and find out the best practical strategies for you to bring your business to a bigger scale.</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="process">
	<h4>III) After our workshop:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Next we go through an 1h or 1h:30m video-screen call and inspect each step and section of the roadmap, outlining all of your brand</li>
		<li>Give you a "modular" understanding of your practice and the optimal strategy you want to go with</li>
		<li>You’ll have a full roadmap laid out in front of you.</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="process">
	<h4>IV) Final step:</h4>
	<p>At the end of the brand intensive presentation, we’ll put together a comprehensive & personalized report in great detail and send it directly to you.</p>
